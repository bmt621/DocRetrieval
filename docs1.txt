 1  Introduction  
1.1 Context and Scope  
The Digital Economy Initiative for Africa ( DE4A)2 aims to ensure that 
every individual, business, and government in Africa will be digitally 
enabled by 2030 in support of the African Union’s Digital 
Transformation Strategy in Africa3. The Federal Government of 
Nigeria through the Nigeria Digital Economy Policy and Strategy 
(NDEPS) document has set a corresponding target of achieving 95 
per cent digital literacy by 20304.  
However, there is currently no national framework that can serve as 
a guide for stakeholders on what constitutes the competenc e areas 
and specific competencies of literacy  and skills  required for a digital 
Nigeria. Thus, the National Information Technology Development 
Agency (NITDA), the apex IT agency responsible for developmental 
regulation of the sector in Nigeria, has taken u p responsibility to 
lead the development of a national digital literacy framework.   
This document outlines the proposed framework. It aims to set a 
digital literacy and skills agenda for Nigeria by providing a clear and 
consistent definition of digital li teracy , its competence areas  and 
specific competencies for the purpose of:  
i. Offering policy makers a mean s to frame digital literacy  
policies , monitor  and support their implementation;  
ii. Building digital literacy curricula, modules and programs to 
afford proper planning, coordination and standardization of 
digital literacy training and skills development in Nigeria;

 iii. Enabling  assessment and certification, data collection, analyses 
and measurement of the number and/or percentage of digitally 
literate Ni gerians and their level of digital skills; 
1.2 Review of Existing Frameworks  
A number of internationally recognized digital literacy frameworks 
were reviewed including: the International Computer Driving License 
(ICDL); IC3 Digital Literacy; Microsoft Digi tal Literacy;  the European 
Commission’s Digital Competence Framewo rk for C itizens 
(DigComp ); and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Digital Literacy Global Framework.  
The review found that m ost of the  digital lite racy curricula, 
assessment  tools and certification exams derived from  the existing  
frameworks are PC -centric , while everyday use scenarios requiring 
digital literacy competence, particularly those in developing 
countries, majorly use mobile devices. For ex ample, s tatistics show 
that the PC to Mobile market share in Nigeria was 15.76% to 
83.55% as at November 20215. In terms of unique subscribers, a 
2017 study by Pew Research6 found that 80% of adults in Nigeria 
owned some type of mobile phone.  
It is worth noting that the existing frameworks were developed for 
use on a ‘network -enabled device’ regardless of whether it is a 
personal computer, table, smart phone or mobile phone. Thus, 
attainment of a holistic view of digital litera cy cognizant of N igeria’s 
mobile -first approach will require minimal adap tation at the level of 
specific competences through their expression in the context in 
which the competences are taught.

 1.3 Methodology for Development of the Framework  
To ensure speedy development of a robust framework, a 
combination of the European Digital Competence Framework for 
Citizens, also known as DigComp,  and elements of UNESCO’s digital 
literacy global framework have been adopted for domestication.  
Adoption of these frameworks  is informed by the following principles:  
• The core skill of digital literacy can be seen as a discrete skill but 
with critical interrelationships with other core life skills;  
• The core skill of digital literacy is contextualised; each context in 
which individuals operate has its own core skills requirements, 
expectations and  rules which need to be learned;  
• An individual's performance at any time will be influenced by the 
interplay of a number of performance variables ; 
• The framework s reflect  contemporary  use of English in Nigeria.  
 
Fig. 1.3 (a) DigComp  Conceptual Reference Model

 DigComp was first published in 2013 as a tool to improve citizens’ 
digital competence, help policy -makers formulate policies that 
support digital competence building, and plan edu cation and training 
initiatives to improve the digital competence of specific target 
groups. The conceptual reference model  consists of 5 competence 
areas  (Dimension 1) , and 21 competences  (Dimension 2) . Additional 
dimensions outlined in the latest version , DigComp 2.27, include 
Proficiency levels (Dimension 3), Examples of knowledge, skills and 
attitudes (Dimension 4) and Use cases (Dimension 5).  
UNESCO’s digital literacy global framework  was developed by 
synthesizing of existing regional, national and sub -national 
frameworks to identify competences relevant for the global context, 
and in particular, analyzing the extent to which existing, well -
developed and all -encompassing frameworks would be relevant for 
all countries, whether economically rich or  poor, and over time.  
UNESCO worked on the project to develop a methodology that can 
serve as the foundation for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 
thematic Indicator 4.4.2: “Percentage of youth/adults who have 
achieved at least a minimum level of profici ency in digital literacy 
skills”. UNESCO ’s framework  has looked  at the key mobile functions 
that enable various economic sectors8.The fifteen  functions 
identified fall into two categories:  
• general functions such as turning on/off and charging the 
device, sending and receiving text messages, searching for 
goods and services, and comparing price information; and

literacy -skills-2018-en.pdf

 • financial transactions such as topping up one’s account through 
an agent.  
It was  observe d that the digital literacy competence levels required 
for achieving the same function depend on the specific devices used. 
The range of operations available on an application designed for the 
smartphone is much wider, and consequently, the understanding of 
the competence and the proficiency level required on a smartphone 
can be higher. Based on the identified functions,  use cases  of 
specific competences can be applied directly to the mobile -centric 
and mobile -first users that are prevalent in Nigeria and Africa.

 UNESCO’s digital literacy global framework proposed  among others,  
the addition of a ‘Devices and Software Operations’  competence 
area to what is c urrently covered in DigComp 2.2 : 
Table 1.3(b) : Additional Competence Area with Two Competences Proposed by 
UNESCO’s Digital Literacy Global Frame work 
Competence area  Competences  
0. Devices and 
software operations  0.1 Physical operations of digital devices (To identify and 
use the functions and features of the hardware tools and 
technologies)  
0.2 Software operations in digital devices (To know and 
understand the data, information and/or digital content that 
are needed to operate software tools and technologies)  
 
Starting with DigComp 2.2 and incorporating aspects of UNESCO’s  
global framework , an updated reference model is obtained, which  
considers the above competences necessary to be added for the 
mobile -centric and mobile -first population in Nigeria  and Africa .

 1.4 Business Case and Potential Impact  
Development of a national framework aligned with global standard, as 
opposed to adopting all com er’s framework with no defined curriculum 
that could result in measurable outcomes will have a positive rippling 
effect on the country’s economy. It will:  
• Create a rich and vibrant local industry of digital training 
service providers, content creators and  publishers, marketers, 
assessment and certification bodies aligned with globally 
recognized standards;  
• Create a large value chain that will facilitate youth 
engagement, entrepreneurship development, MSME 
Development, and women empowerment in line with th e best 
global practice;  
• Trigger Nigerians to achieve globally accepted certifications 
that will increase job opportunities and mobility across the 
world, and yield billions of dollars of economic value to Nigeria;  
• Enhance the civil service by improving e fficiency, productivity, 
and increasing service -delivery orientation;  
• Encouraging establishment of local Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEM’s) to meet increased local demand for IT 
tools and equipment;  
• Increase demand for ICT and broadband, thus helping 
implementation of broadband and ICT policies;  
• Accelerate the achiev ement of a world -leading digital economy 
Nigeria; a nation that creates, uses and supplies advanced 
digital technologies and content to improve productivity across 
all sectors.

 2  Digital Literacy and Skills  
Nigerians stand on the periphery  of a technolog ical revolution, the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), that has fundamentally alter ed the 
way we live, work, and relate to one another9. This r evolution wa s built 
on the d igital or 3rd Industrial Revolution  (3IR)  that has expanded  into 
disruptive techno logies and trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 
Virtual Reality (VR),  Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, autonomous 
driving  vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials 
science, energy storage, quantum computing and much mor e that will 
require more technical capabilities than career practices formally 
demanded.  
 
 
 
In order for Nigeria to improve its digital advantage and build 
sustainable prosperity, it must prepare for the challenges of a 21st 
century dynamic work environment. Building a digitally skilled  
workforce will accelerate Nigeria’s economic growth and 
development.

 The future of Nigeria is clearly hinged on the development of 
capacity of inhabitants’ and how swiftly a strategy for digi tal literacy 
and skills integration can be put in place.  As Nigeria aspires to 
become a regional hub for providing human capital resource support 
to Africa with the implementation of the African Continental Free 
Trade Area (AfCFTA), the need for technolog y skills is growing in 
every sector of the Nigerian digital economy.  
2.1 Need for Digital Literacy  
Given that people around the world have the same human potential, 
every job and career, every field of study and even social and 
personal lives are increasin gly impacted by technology. And as 
nations compete in today’s global world, those economies who have 
invested in the human capital and digital skills of their citizens are 
best prepared to grow. In order to level the playing field, Nigeria 
must move its ci tizens to a greater competitive position in the global 
economic marketplace.  
Equipping Nigerians with relevant digital literacy skills to keep up 
with the best global practices will put the current workers, youths 
and other professionals in ready mode for  opportunities that may 
open up within and beyond the shores of Nigeria.  This will diversify 
the economy, significantly reduce unemployment and enhance 
labour productivity and mobility. I n turn, this would improve 
investment and transform Nigeria into a c ountry well known for 
technology, problem solving and critical thinking.  
The evolution of technology has also led to the stratification of 
countries depending on how they adopt digital technologies.  The 
economic and social development of digitally litera te countries has 
outstripped those of countries that have fail ed to embrace digital  
 
13 
 literacy.  Unfortunately, Nigeria currently f alls under the latter 
category.  The purpose of this initiative to create a National Digital 
Literacy Framework, implementation s trategy and measurement 
metrics is aimed at reversing this narrative. The skills deficits in 
human capital that hinder Nigeria from thriving in the global digital 
economy would be, once and for all o vercome.  
Digital Literacy is important for several interconnected reasons.  
i. Nigerians; current workforce, students, graduates and 
professionals need to be prepared for a successful adulthood 
in a world increasingly saturated with digital technologies;  
ii. Nigerians ar e already engaging with digital technologies and 
digital media and using them to find information and 
communicate meaning in different modes and formats and this 
provides significant opportunities and challenges that it is 
important to address;  
iii. Not all Ni gerians are equally equipped with the skills 
knowledge and understanding that will allow them to critically 
engage with technology and to use it well;  
iv. Developing digital literacy can help students to access subject 
knowledge at a time when digital technol ogies are changing 
the way knowledge is created and communicated;  
v. Digital literacy will help schools to engage with students’ lived 
experiences and existing knowledge as well as extending and 
diversifying these experiences and knowledge to make 
learning m ore relevant and purposeful;  
vi. The need to create a pool of knowledgeable and skilled 
manpower that will facilitate technology acquisition, 
assimilation, diffusion, mobility and raise productivity.   
 
14 
 Digital Literacy is a global priority and criterion for em ployment with 
over 1.5 billion current virtual workforce vacancies across the world 
(IDC)10. Competence in English language is no longer the primary 
indicato r of literacy and job readiness;  it is now digital literacy. 
Digital Literacy is critical to immedi ate empowerment of our 
population to enable Nigerians to develop the skills necessary to 
achieve more, to be distinguished and advance in the digital era and 
to truly solve the conundrum around education, unemployment, low 
productivity and economic diversi fication.  
2.2 Starting it All with Digital Literacy  
Digital Literacy is a foundation element of success in today’s 
technology -driven world regardless of educational goals, career 
pursuits or job function and possessing a strong grasp of digital 
technologi es that drive much of the world is critical.  
As the world and indeed Nigeria continue to grapple with a growing  
jobs crisis, and most Nigerians across all categories of workforce 
and professions lacking in the basic technological skills needed for 
real-world business situations despite having grown up immersed in 
technology; proficiency in digital literacy and its validation is no 
longer an option.     
In the age of ubiquitous computing, digital l iteracy has become a 
critical information technology co mpeten ce regarded as a survival 
skill, a new form of literacy, a prerequisite for creativity, innovation 
and entrepreneurship, without which citizens can neither participate  
fully in society, nor acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to 
meet with 21st centur y national and international workplace needs.   
 
10https://www.eweek.com/mobile/mobile -worker -population -to-reach -1.3-billion -by-2015-idc/  
 
15 
 Digital literacy is pervasive today, five out of every six people in the 
world not only own a mobile communications device —a device that 
can also serve as a bank, an information -access portal, an 
employment s tation, an entertainment player, and a means of self -
expression, but drives commerce in all successful countries in a 
borderless digital world.   
 
2.3 The Rise of Global Digital Competence  
The entire globe is now undergoing the most momentous economic 
and social change in 150 years. The change initiated by the impact 
of literacy and —within the past 20 years —by skills in the digital 
world. The rise of digital literacy in emerging countries ha s enabled 
them to compete, even more successfully, across the borderless 
realm of digital commerce with high -income countries.   
Although, literacy has long been recognized as an essential 
ingredient in the workplace defining a person’s ability to read, write 
and cope with arithmetic. The advent of the millennium and the 
rapidity with which technology has changed society has changed  the 
concept of “literacy” to assumed new meanings.   
The foundation for the workforce is now entwined with its 
fundamental ability to communicate effectively to embrace all forms 
in which knowledge or meaning can be expressed much more now 
than words. Dig ital-based expression can now be found in almost 
every profession and activity, improving performance, output and 
creating wealth. The need for digital literacy will only grow more 
acute as computing power increases and costs decrease.   
 
 
16 
 2.4 The Increasing  Need for Workforce Flexibility  
The Nigerian workforce needs digital literacy to retain flexibility and 
mobility of career and job openings. A worker who is digitally 
illiterate today is a worker condemned to ever -shrinking choices of 
employment. The shrin king of job opportunities among the digitally 
illiterate is terrifying and will become more pronounced in the next 
ten years as industry demand increases, technology advances, older 
workers retire and the decline in the standard of education.   
In some occ upations, especially those requiring a university 
education, evidence suggests that shortages will persist because of 
the shortage in supply of qualified workers compared to projected 
employer demand. Increasing the supply of local graduates for 
these occu pations and equipping them with relevant skills for 
international or global engagement will be important elements of the 
solution.  
However, in many cases, ICT skill shortages are more related to 
workers not possessing the right combination of specific tra ining and 
experience required by Nigerian employers, such as digital literacy, 
rather than a lack of formal qualifications. Changes in the digital 
economy are raising concerns that a digital literacy divide is 
emerging, where some groups are falling behind  in their skills and 
have less access to new technology. This is of particular concern 
because future effective participation in the labour market will be 
closely linked to digital literacy.  
In the face of today’s pressure to retool and skill Nigerians fr om all 
sectors with skill needs for the 21st century world, the need to 
provide the foundation -stone for success in terms of digital literacy  
 
17 
 and skills training is crucial and Nigeria can take advantage of the 
concepts and initiatives already in place to advance.  
2.5 The Expansion of the Service Sector  
A new realization is becoming top -of-mind in the U.S., Japan and 
some European countries. While the production of hard physical 
goods is important, national prosperity heavily depends on 
increasing producti vity in the service sector , which is now 
responsible for 70%  of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 76 % of 
employment depends more heavily on digital literacy.  
Even within the manufacturing sector, one of the most promising 
areas for growth is the addition o f services. The rise of the service 
sector relative to agriculture and industry means that Nigerians are 
more exposed to the borderless digital economy.   
Nigeria’s service sector is a field in which Nigeria has momentum 
and national advantage. ICT has the  potential to make Nigeria a 
global economic center. The Nigerian ICT sector is growing fast and 
is considered to have the best prospects for the economic growth of 
the country. The ICT sector contributed 14% to the GDP in 2019 up 
from 13.32% that was reco rded in the preceding year11.  In 2020, 
the ICT sector contributed 17.83% to the GDP and has already 
contributed 17.9% to the GDP in the second quarter of 202112.  
Productivity impacts are quickly felt. Improving productivity in the 
service sector takes mu ch less effort than improving productivity in 
manufacturing for example. The Federal Government of Nigeria 
recognizes ICT as the enabler for developing other critical sectors 
including education, healthcare, agriculture and manufacturing.

2021/amp   
 
18 
 The service secto r is recession -resistant, with a longer lag time built 
in regarding economic trends. Nigeria’s service economy is not as 
heavily dependent on only Nigerian trade as other sectors. Half of 
Nigerian service revenues are made selling to other countries. ICT 
services are digital, without borders. Global purchasers treat 
Nigerian service companies as equally competent with rivals, so 
there is no inbred disadvantage to being Nigerian.  Nigeria’s 
population, representing the “world in miniature”, has major global 
market connectivity advantages and Nigeria has the touchstone of 
prosperity for the ICT sector: a well -educated workforce if 
developed. The ‘price of admission’ for this opportunity, however, is 
digital literacy. The ‘service sector opportunity’ that arises from an 
otherwise well -educated workforce, is diminished if the workforce 
does not have adequate digital literacy.  
   
 
19 
 3. Need for a Digital Literacy Standard  
The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic has triggered a global rush 
towards the digital transformation of nearly all aspects of daily life.  
Given the pace of these changes, digital literacy and digital skills 
have become a mandatory part of education and training f or all 
people. It is critical for Nigeria to rapidly develop a standard to 
incorporate high -quality digital literacy and digital skills education 
and training programs across all age groups.  
Building a reference framework to develop national -level digital  
literacy and skills agenda and standard for Nigeria citizens ranging 
from students and the workforce to seniors has multiple benefits;  
• It will guide and facilitate the development of Nigeria 
curriculum and programs for digital literacy, digital skills, 
and/or digital readiness;  
• With a globally shared baseline understanding of what terms 
like digital skills and digital literacy mean, Nigeria, nonprofits, 
and industry can coordinate digital skills efforts and effectively 
enhance the level of digital literac y and digital skills of the 
citizens in local communities and nationwide;  
• The common set of definitions and standards will enable 
monitoring and reporting that can help to strategically allocate 
resources to identify and bridge digital skills gaps;  
 
The standard will help to:  
• Trigger globally accepted certification that can increase job 
opportunities and mobility across the world, which can yield 
billions of dollars of economic value to Nigeria in the fast - 
 
20 
 expanding digital economy and help to overcome t he economic 
challenges caused by COVID -19;  
• Enhance the implementation of Government Policies and 
recommendations; e -Government Master Plan, Nigeria National 
Broadband Plan 2020 – 2025, National Digital Economy Policy 
and Strategy 2020 - 2030, National Str ategy for Public Service 
Reform and recommendations of National Council on 
Communications and Digital Economy 2016 – 2020.  
 
Fig. 3 Examples of r elevant government policies  and recommendations 
that demand a national digital literacy standard  
 
A digital literacy standard for Nigeria will prepare Nigerians to 
answer the challenge of inadequacies in digital literacy and skills 
acquisition.  Combined with a call -to-action of app ropriate measure, 
and with an investment of energy and adequate resources it ca n 
help create the world’s most digitally s killful nation.   
 
 
21 
 3.1 Challenges to Standard Setting  
Perhaps one of the biggest challenges to the development of digital 
literacy in Ni geria is insufficient access to IT facilities, tools and 
equipment by citizens including students and workers at many 
locations across the country. To promote digital transformation, 
equal emphasis needs to be allocated to digital skills development 
as is to infrastructure development.   
Amongst some emerging and developing economies specifically, 
whilst there is an emphasis on infrastructure development, these 
countries will not be able to leverage the full potential of such 
investments, without a comprehe nsive skilling programme, which 
educates the disadvantaged and disconnected population about the 
benefits of digital tools. Furthermore, without consistent and 
comparative measurement indicators to identify the location of the 
digitally illiterate sectors of the population, policy makers are 
disempowered to pursue digital transformation objectives.  
To ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed, a 
standardized data collection strategy is required to measure an 
internationally accepted digital  literacy index. This index must be 
defined by a framework of digital literacy responsive to the fluid 
needs of the digital economy.  
Recent communiqués  of Government have made pronouncements 
on addressing the digital divide but have largely focused on 
infrastructure development, financial inclusion or digital trade. 
Insufficient attention has been paid to the need for digital skills, 
partly due to the difficulties in defining and measuring digital 
literacy.    
 
22 
 Digital Literacy, as with general literacy, pro vides an individual with 
the capability to achieve other valued outputs in life, especially in 
the modern digital economy. Unlike literacy, the definition of digital 
literacy is contested, leading to the development of different and 
inconsistent sets of in dicators for its measurement.  
A consistent, standardized definition is required for the purposes of 
data collection, analyses and measurement. However, to date, there 
have not been consensus definitions of digital literacy in Nigeria, 
which has led to pro nounced educational and training gaps in digital 
literacy and skills across regions, sectors, and genders.  
Digital literacy is not just about surviving, but thriving and not about 
having individuals work harder but ensuring they know how to work 
smarter, understand the rules of the game, waste less time trying to 
make things work, and eventually be more productive and 
competitive.  
3.2 Policy Mandate  
Coordination of all relevant stakeholders to work with a common 
objective of developing a national digital literacy framework and 
standard that will help to equip Nigerians with digital literacy and 
skills, and put the citizens in ready mode for opportunities that will 
open up within and beyond the shores of the country is critical at 
the moment. This effort wi ll promote diversification of the country’s 
economy, significantly reduce unemployment and enhance labour 
productivity and exportation.

the apex IT agency responsible for developmental regul ation of the 
sector in Nigeria, has taken up responsibility to lead the 
development of a national digital literacy framework.   
 
23 
 NITDA is established by NITDA Act 2007 and mandated by Sections 
6 a, g and i to -  
i. Create a framework for the planning, research, development, 
standardization, application, coordination, monitoring, 
evaluation and regulation of Information Technology 
practices, activities and systems in Nigeria and all matters 
related thereto;   
ii. Create i ncentives to promote the use of information 
technology in all spheres of life in Nigeria, and   
iii. Introduce appropriate regulatory policies and incentives to 
encourage private sector investmen t in the information 
technology industry.  
   
 
24 
 4. Roadmap and Call fo r Action  
While there is no one -size fits all approach, there is a wealth of 
knowledge and experience available internationally from successful 
international frameworks and standards.  
This provides a useful template from which we can outline a sound 
roadma p for embarking on this quest spans four phases:  
i. Articulation of Nigeria’s digital literacy vis ion and first version 
of National Digital L iteracy framework;  
ii. Building an implementation plan consisting of  short and long 
term targets ;  
iii. Socialization of the framework and engagement with key 
stakeholders;  
iv. Continuous engagement of relevant partners throughou t the 
program launch and beyond;  
v. Establishment of supporting government policies.  
4.1 Nigeria’s Digital Literacy V ision and Targets  
The vision  
For all Nigerian citizens to have digital skills equal to or exceeding the 
demands of their daily transactions and occupations in a Digital  
Nigeria; a nation that creates, uses and supplies advanced digital 
technologies and content to improve productivity  across all sectors  
of the economy.  
National Targets  
i. 60% Digital Literacy for Youths and Adults in Nigeria by 2025  
(NNBP 2020 -2025)  
ii. 95% Digital Literacy levels across States and Local 
Governments by 2030 (NDEPS 2020 - 2030)   
 
25 
 Even though, not everyone nee ds a high level of digital literacy, 
participation in a digital economy requires digital literacy across 
every sector such that everyone will possess a sufficient working 
knowledge of current digital usage to function in their daily lives 
using the availab le digital media within their disposal.  
Through policies and programs and human resources skills 
development, Nigeria must take appropriate steps to make sure that 
Nigerian businesses can attract and retain the workers they need to 
prepare Nigeria for the  economy of tomorrow. Nonetheless, 
achieving this feat will require a range of integrated efforts 
coordinated across government, industry and relevant partners.  
4.2 The National Digital Literacy  Framework  (NDLF ) 
This national digital literacy  framework  (NDLF)is an adoption of the 
European Commission’s Digital Competence Framework for Citizens 
(DigComp 2.2)13with incorporation of  required elements of Mobile 
Information Literacy (MIL), which are critical to Nigeria  and Africa.  
MIL is  represented within the c ompetence s’ dimension  of NDLF  with 
the addition to DigComp of a new C ompetence Area (0) called  
Devices and Software Operation  as proposed by UNESCO14. It has 
the following two competences:  
• Physical operations of digital devices  
• Software operations of digital devices  
The NDLF basic model  thus consists of : 
• Dimension 1 ( 6 Competence Areas ) 
• Dimension 2 (23  Competences ) 
• Dimension 3 ( 8 Proficiency Levels )

literacy -skills-2018-en.pdf

Fig. 4.2 National Digital Literacy Framework Basic Model  
 
NDLF adopts the definition of proficiency lev els from DigComp (i.e. 
descriptions of specific skills to be gained for each of the 
competencies). Dimension 4 ( Examples Of Knowledge, Skills And 
Attitudes ) and Dimension 5 (Use Cases) are also adopted from 
DigComp for the purpose of both learning and empl oyment uses . 
For the additional Devices and Software Operation Competence Area  
(0) that was  introduced and added to the DigComp conceptual 
reference model , the definitions and functions listed in  Table 1.3(a) 
and Table 1.3(b)  will be used to develop Dimensi ons 3, 4 and 5.  
 
 
 
27 
 4.3Key Stakeholders  
Coordination of all relevant stakeholders to work with a common 
objective of developing  and implementing  a national digital literacy 
framework and standard that will help to equip Nigerians with digital 
literacy and skills, and put the citizens in ready mode for opportunities 
that will open up within and beyond the shores of the country is critical 
at the mo ment. A list of  key stakeholders to be continuously consulted 
for this work is attached as an appendix at the end of the document.  
4.4 Short Term Implementation Plan  
In the short -term, the following plan can be followed:  
i. Domestication of the adopted Framew ork/Standard for Digital 
Literacy, by articulating, at the level of individual comp etences 
0 – 5 how these would be expressed for Mobile Information 
Literacy . 
ii. Conduct of baseline assessment to establish pro ficiency level 
of Nigerians in digital l iteracy . 
iii. Agreement on a national digital literacy framework through 
adaptation and domesti cation of an existing framework .  
iv. Reviewing of education curriculum at all levels to integrate 
digital literacy  into relevant modules and  programs so as  to 
address national and  global skills need.  
v. Accreditation and registration of digital literacy training and 
certification service providers who meet set criteria.  
vi. Adoption and domestication of an internationally recognized 
digital literacy certification standard for purpose of  baseline 
assessment and validation of developed/adapted framework.   
 
28 
 4.5 Long Term Implementation Plan  
Sponsoring of an Executive Bill (Digital Literacy Act) that shall 
provide for creation of   
i. Digital Literacy Institute (DLI) – An institute with the main 
objective of advancing digital literacy training, assessment and 
certification to equip every Nigerian with appropriate digital 
skills to cope with the digital era.  
ii. Digital Literacy Council (DL C) – A council composed of experts 
from Government, Industry and Academia with the main 
objective of taking up necessary actions required to attain 
objectives of the DLI in a well -planned manner and to manage 
and supervise all activities of the Institute.  
iii. Digital Literacy Management Office (DLMO) – An office setup at 
the Presidency to provide Governance.  
The Digital Literacy Institute (DLI) will have a Fund of its own called 
the Digital Literacy Fund (DLF). The following income shall be the 
part of the Fun d:

29 
 5. Recommendations  
The following recommendations are hereby made for further 
necessary action:  
1. NITDA should officially communicate to the EU and UNESCO on 
the adoption of the European Commission’s DigComp 
Framework and UNESCO’s digital literacy global framework to 
seek for synergy in implementation  of the national framework . 
2. The relevant policy make rs should  create policies that:  
i. Establish digital literacy as a core subject in primary, 
secondary, and tertiary schools , in the same category as 
English Language and Mathematics,  and for the purpose of 
qualifying examinations, especially in NECO and  JAMB .  
ii. Make digital l iteracy a criterion for graduation at tertiary 
level and for admission at post graduate level in the  Nigeria n 
education system;  
iii. Mandate having a recognized digital literacy certification for 
employment and promotion  of all public service wo rkforce in 
all job roles and cadres ; 
iv. Mandate career specific digital skill certification as additional 
criterion for employment and promotion of workers in the 
affected sectors.  
3. Nigeria urgently requires an indicator for measuring the uptake 
of digital lit eracy across all sectors of country economy to 
ensure that policies are targeted to the areas of most need. To 
ensure this becomes a reality, the following recommendations 
are made:   
i. Develop or a dopt a global standard digital literacy index for 
baseline a ssessment and validation of developed framework;   
 
30 
 ii. Create a digital skills p ortfolio to guide digital s kills 
acquisition standard ; 
iii. Develop a multi -dimensional national digital literacy index 
that aligns the demand and supply of digital skills required 
by all role players.  
6. Conclusion  
In line with the total commitment of all the UN member states as well 
as development partners to ac hieve Agenda 2030, especially as Nigeria 
embarks on a decade of action (2020 -2030); efforts need to be geared 
towards improving the human capital of all Nig erians, especially in 
areas of digital literacy and s kills. This will empower millions of 
Nigerians to be well positioned in assuming new role s in job reset s hifts 
of the 4th Industrial Revolution and as global skills shortage hits an all -
time high of 54%.  
 
Digital Literacy is the most audacious enabler of lifting 100 million 
Nigerians out of poverty as targeted by Federal Government. 
Digitalization, transition towards greener economy and demographic 
changes will continue to increased digital skills gap.

  5 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
Introduction  
The objective of the Digital Literacy Global Framework (DLGF) project is to develop a methodology that can 
serve as the foundation for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) thematic Indicator 4.4.2: “Percentage of 
youth/adults who have ac hieved at least a minimum level of proficiency in digital literacy skills”.  
To achieve this objective, we have built on the European Commission’s Digital Competence Framework for 
Citizens (DigComp 2.0) as the initial framework and conducted four empirical  studies to develop the 
proposed framework:  
1) a synthesis of existing regional, national and sub -national frameworks to identify competences 
relevant for the global context, and in particular, analysing the extent to which existing, well -
developed and all -encompassing frameworks would be relevant (i) for all countries, whether 
economically rich or poor, and (ii) over time;  
2) an analysis of digital literacy competences demonstrated in information and communications 
technology (ICT) use in major socio -economic sectors, with a focus on developing countries;  
3) an in -depth consultation to seek expert views on the appropriateness and use of a global framework; 
and  
4) an online consultation to seek experts’ feedback on the proposed framework. We have made 
particular eff orts to include examples and expert views from countries in the following regions: Asia, 
the European Union (EU), high -income . 
  6 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
1. Definitions of digital literacy  
The importance of digital literacy is evidenced by the many national and regional efforts to  develop and 
implement digital literacy frameworks and strategic plans to bolster citizens’ digital literacy. However, the 
reasons for countries to adopt and develop frameworks vary. For example, the Republic of Korea intends to 
enhance the digital literac y of public officials to increase the efficiency, transparency and delivery of services 
to citizens through public administration (Young, 2016). Oman, on the other hand, adopted the Microsoft 
Digital Literacy Curriculum to bridge the digital divide, bolste r its ICT industry and build young citizens’ 
employment capacity (Sultanate of Oman Information Technology Authority, 2008).  
Likewise, definitions for digital literacy also differ. Some consider digital literacy as a new literacy comprising 
multiple dimen sions and represented in new, multimodal social practices. For instance, Ala -Mutka (2011) 
defined digital literacy for DigComp as an emergent literacy from other literacies and, as such, is greater than 
the sum of the other literacies, which include inform ation literacy, media literacy, Internet literacy, and 
computer or ICT literacy (i.e.  hardware and software knowledge and skills). Similarly, in Kenya’s Basic 
Education Curriculum Framework, digital literacy encompasses traditional literacies and computer literacy.  
The proposed DLGF is intended to serve for monitoring, assessment and further development of digital 
literacy, taking into consideration different levels of development.  Hence, the resulting framework needs to 
be operationalisable to serve this p urpose. In reviewing related frameworks collected from government and 
non-government agencies, we find that the following notions recurred constantly: “access”, “manage”, 
“understand”, “integrate”, “communicate”, “evaluate” and “create”. Hence, we propose the following 
definition for digital literacy:  
Digital literacy is the ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate and create 
information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs and 
entrepreneurship. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, 
information literacy and media literacy.  
Our observations during the various stages of our empirical work show that there is a general acceptance 
that competence in digital literacy requires the person to have the necessary knowledge and skills , but views 
differ regarding attitudes . We hold the view that attitudes are necessary for a person to have the commitment 
and motivation to achieve competent perfo rmance, and should be included in the DLGF.  
2. Mapping of ICT and digital literacy frameworks and examples of competences  
As mentioned, DigComp 2.0 was selected as the reference digital literacy framework for this project. It has 
been synthesized from oth er, major digital literacy frameworks and undergone a long consultation and 
development process, thus presenting a comprehensive view on competence areas and competences from 
economically -advanced countries. The DigComp 2.0 framework (Vuorikari et al., 201 6) is presented in  
Table 1 .

5.4 Identifying digital competence gaps  
In order to ensure that the proposed global framework is relevant to countries at different levels of 
development, we began the study with two mapping exercises, one on cross -national and selected national 
lCT and digital literacy frameworks and the other on digital literacy competences required in use cases of 
digital technology in some major economic sectors. These are reported in this section.  
3.1 Mapping of cross -national and  selected national lCT and digital literacy frameworks  
We conducted a systematic search for digital literacy frameworks in the targeted regions and countries using 
country names in combination with search terms, including digital, literacy, competences, sk ills, ICT, 
computer and information. A key limitation to the search results is our searches being constrained to 
information in the English language. Nonetheless, we were able to find information about specific digital 
literacy frameworks being adopted in 47 countries (see Appendix 1 ). Table 2  shows the distribution of the 47 
countries across geographical regions and the income level of the country according to the World Bank 
income levels. Figure 1  presents the geographic locations of the countries for whi ch the frameworks have 
been collected.

Note:  Some countries have more than one framework belonging to the same framework type. Only one icon is shown for each framework t ype 
collected for that country. A limitation of the map generation software is that some icons overlap with each other. Appendix 1 provides  an accurate 
list of the distribution of frameworks analysed across countries.   
10 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
There are several important observations based on  an examination of the collected frameworks listed in 
Appendix 1:  
1. The framework information we have collected are not exhaustive of those adopted in these 47 
countries.   
2. In a number of cases, the countries have multiple frameworks in use, likely for diffe rent purposes.  
3. There are two types of frameworks, frameworks developed at the national or sub -national level and 
frameworks adopted from the training courses and assessment frameworks used by commercial 
enterprises. It should be noted that the enterprise f rameworks do not have an official status as a 
national framework. However, these are often adopted by national entities (e.g.  Colombian police 
force) for the purpose of human resource development and qualification requirements for jobs.  
4. 11 countries have d eveloped their own national frameworks, and of these 7 have in addition adopted 
enterprise frameworks. On the other hand, 36 of the sampled countries have only adopted 
enterprise frameworks.  
5. We found a total of three different enterprise frameworks adopte d by the 43 countries that use 
them, in decreasing order of popularity:  
a. International Computer Drivers Licence (ICDL)1—adopted in 31 countries;  
b. Certiport Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC³)2—adopted in 13 countries; and  
c. Microsoft Digital Liter acy Standard Curriculum3—adopted in 11 countries.  
6. Some countries adopt multiple enterprise frameworks, nine having adopted two (Colombia, Egypt, 
Indonesia, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, South Africa, Thailand, United Arab Emirates (UAE)) and two having 
adopted all  three frameworks (Malaysia and Viet Nam).  
Our findings thus show that multinational commercial enterprises have a major role in influencing the digital 
literacy competences that are being taught and assessed, particularly in developing countries. The ente rprise 
courses and examinations are sometimes delivered by international organizations or businesses, and 
sometimes by national providers in collaboration with them.  
While the content coverage found in the digital literacy frameworks varies, there are gene rally five types of 
content: purpose of the framework, competence areas and competences, learning domains (such as 
knowledge, skills and attitudes), how the tasks are to be performed and the digital tools to be used. In 
proceeding further to map the framew orks to competence areas and competences, we find that the 
language used in some of the frameworks are too general to warrant accurate mapping.    
We have selected six of the national frameworks (Costa Rica, India, Kenya, Philippines, Chile and British 
Columbia (Canada)) that are most clearly written with regard to the competency areas, as well as the three 
enterprise frameworks to map against the DigComp 2.0 framework. The salient features of these nine 
frameworks are presented through fact sheets, which c an be found in Appendix 2a to 2i .

In conducting the mapping, we have adopted a low -inference approach to reduce the researcher’s subjective 
judgement. Under this principle, when the source framework and DigComp use the exact same words, a 
direct 1:1 mappin g was performed. For competences in source documents that do not use words found in 
the DigComp framework, a codebook was developed to manage and organize synonymous words to code 
competences. In cases where the source document description of a competence is so general that it can be 
interpreted to map onto more than one competence, these are not mapped based on the low -inference 
principle.  
In the mapping process, we have identified two areas of digital literacy competences that may not most 
appropriately capture the contexts and concerns reflected in the frameworks if the mapping were to be 
confined only to those competence areas and competences in the DigComp framework:  
1. Devices and software operations (CA0) —This relates to basic operations of the digital devices, such as 
turning them on and off, understanding basic concepts of hardware and software, and operations 
on a graphical user interface.  
2. Career -related competences (CA6) —These refer to competences in the use of digital technologies that 
are importan t productivity tools for particular business sectors. Examples include competences in 
using Learning Management Systems for teachers, computer -aided design (CAD) and computer -
aided manufacturing (CAM) applications for architects, engineers and construction  workers, health 
information systems for medical practitioners, and social media for marketing professionals. Career -
related competences are included in two of the three enterprise frameworks, the ICDL and the 
Microsoft Digital Literacy Standard Curriculum . 
These two competence areas, labeled as 0 and 6, are defined in Appendix 3  and added to the DigComp 
framework for the mapping exercise. In conducting the mapping, each statement/description of 
competences in the framework are mapped (coded) to one of the competences in the extended framework. 
Table 3 presents the results of the mapping exercise.  
3.2 Differences in mapped competences across frameworks  
The results show that competences related CA0 is referenced in all except one of the frameworks, while CA6  
is referenced in one of the national and two of the enterprise frameworks. Table 3 also reveals that the three 
enterprise frameworks have similar coverage of competences, but there is a much wider diversity in national 
frameworks. The diversities in cover age reflect the very different nature of these frameworks. The three 
enterprise frameworks serve relatively similar purposes in framing the courses and certification 
programmes that they offer. The narrowest coverage is found in the national frameworks fro m Chile and 
India, both of which are used as guides for high -stake examinations on digital literacy. The other four national 
frameworks serve as guides for K -12 curricula development and hence include more specific descriptions of 
competences.  
Nonetheless , as there are many other contextual and cultural factors influencing the implementation of 
curriculum frameworks, it is not possible to conclude that these frameworks are comparable in terms of 
their execution or impact. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the competences included in the national 
frameworks differ on the basis of the country’s economic development. Hence, based on the mapping 
results, one would not be able to get much insight about the possible differences in terms of the relative 
impor tance of the various competenc es.12 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2

3.3 Relative importance of the different competences  
The numbers in each cell in Table 3  represent the number of discrete performance standa rds/ 
objectives/learning outcomes/skills in the given framework coded to one of the specific competences. A 
comparison of the frequency of coverage across competences shows the most popularly -valued 
competences to be hardware and software operations (CA0),  information and data literacy (CA1), interacting 
through digital technologies (competence 2.1 or C2.1 for short), developing digital content (C3.1), copyright 
and licenses (C3.3), protecting personal data and privacy (C4.2), and identifying digital compet ence gaps 
(C5.4). Each of these competences are included in eight of the nine frameworks. In particular, it is observed 
that developing digital content  (C3.1, N=107) and browsing, searching and filtering data, information and digital 
content  (C1.1, N=93) h ave the highest number of specific mappings, most of which are contributed by the 
three enterprise frameworks. These are technical competence for individuals working with productivity 
software most often done on a desktop.  
The least -mapped competences are  protecting the environment  (C4.4, N=2) and identifying needs and 
technological responses  (C5.2, N=3). Within the communications and collaboration area, engaging in citizenship 
through digital technologies  (C2.3, N=9) is the least mapped. These indicate th at the competences associated 
with broader social concerns and higher levels of problem -solving receive lower attention and are less 
specified compared to basic technical skills.   
3.4 Proficiency levels and assessment  
The DigComp 1.0 competence framework proposed three proficiency levels, which was later expanded to 
eight proficiency levels in DigComp 2.1 (DigComp 2.1 contains no conceptual updates to DigComp 2.0 
competence areas and competences but it includes updates to proficiency levels and examples of  use), 
defined systematically and accompanied by examples. However, none of the digital literacy frameworks we 
collected provide such comprehensive proficiency level descriptions. In frameworks that serve as the basis 
for K -12 curriculum development, grade  levels in formal schooling are often used as proxies for defining 
proficiency levels. Other frameworks may use broad descriptors such as initial, intermediate and advanced 
(e.g. in the Chilean SIMCE TIC framework).  
4. Mapping of digital literacy competenc es in examples of digital technology use  
To provide meaningful guidelines for the provision of training, monitoring and assessment of digital literacy 
associated with employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship in disparate contextual settings, we were 
inspired by the examples for employment and learning found in the DigComp 2.1 framework, which are 
grounded in specific contexts. We have decided to gather an additional form of empirical input to inform the 
digital literacy framework development: collecting  examples of digital literacy use in everyday contexts in a 
wide range of countries outside of Europe, particularly those within the specified geographical regions.  
Our examples were selected from six sectors: four are major economic and/or employment sect ors 
(agriculture, energy, finance and transportation) that are important in low -income countries, and two involve 
technology use for empowerment of communities suffering from systemic economic, social and political 
vulnerabilities (low -skilled and low -literate women in poor communities and displaced populations such as 
refugees).  14 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
4.1 Methodology for searching and selecting examples  
We used search engines to identify examples through news and media reports in the six sectors in low - and 
middle -income count ries. Two kinds of systematic searches were carried out:  
 Google searches for mainstream media and government websites in the English language; and  
 YouTube searches for videos in any language.  
Often, initial results were followed by a snowball process to se arch for further information from associated 
sources such as App store pages and company websites. Selection criteria for the use cases to be included 
in the competence mapping process are the clarity and richness of information available in English about 
the case.  
The initial round of search resulted in a total of 59 examples of use from countries outside Europe, covering 
all World Bank national income classifications (high -, upper -middle -, lower -middle - and low -income 
countries), with priority given to e xamples from lower -middle - and low -income countries (see Appendix 4  for 
details).  From these, we further selected 20 that have sufficiently detailed information for mapping onto the 
extended DigComp digital literacy competences. These 20 examples (see Tabl e 4) come from 14 countries in 
four regions (Asia, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, and sub -Saharan Africa). While each use case 
is listed with a country based on the search results, the type of scenarios is not necessarily confined to a 
partic ular country. For example, GoFundMe operates in many countries, even though the use case we found 
was for supporting agricultural developments in Somalia.

To more easily understand the convergence of geograp hy and sectors, we graphically present these 
examples on Google Maps in Figure 2 . Examples of use are shown by country and by sector.  16 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2

Note:  Only one icon is shown where countries have more than one example of digital literacy use in the same sector. Due to the limi tation of the 
map generation software, some icons on the map overlap with each other. Table 4 provide s the full list of all examples collected and the 
respective sectors to which they belong.  
17 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
The mapping of examples of use to DigComp competences is more complex compared to the mapping of 
the digital literacy frameworks, comprising of two processes. First , we have to identify the operations that 
the user may need to perform in the task. For example, in using mobile phone or smart phones for 
agriculture -related tasks and operations, there are 10 types of functions that the user needs to master:  
1. Turn on/off  and charge the device  
2. Send and receive text messages  
3. Set or change App language  
4. Share location data  
5. Create a public profile  
6. Search for, choose, download and approve privacy policy of an application  
7. Intra -app finance transactions  
8. Search for goods and servi ces and compare price information  
9. Buyer and seller interaction  
10. Top up account through an agent.  
The 15 functions identified in the 20 use cases (see Appendix 5 ) fall into two categories:  
1) general functions such as turning on/off and charging the device, se nding and receiving text 
messages, searching for goods and services, and comparing price information; and  
2) financial transactions such as topping up one’s account through an agent.  
It should be pointed out that there are differences in the specific functi ons that are found to be operating in 
the six sector s (see Appendix 6 ). It should also be pointed out that the above list of functions does not cover 
all uses in the six sectors we mapped. For example, there are cases of migrants learning to programme and 
create media products, and women with low levels of literacy learning to build structures, such as toilets, 
from watching instructional videos. We have not included these due to a lack of details. The purpose of the 
current mapping exercise is to demonstra te the methodology rather than to achieve exhaustive coverage, 
which is not possible.   
One important observation is that all of the examples can be completed using a phone or a tablet. They do 
not require the use of a computer but require a network -enabled  device, which can be a mobile phone or a 
smartphone connected to the Internet. Furthermore, the digital literacy competence levels required for 
achieving the same function depend on the specific devices used. For example, the process of searching for 
good s and services in order to compare prices differ greatly depending on whether a mobile phone or a 
smartphone is used. In mapping the same function on these two types of devices, we find that, even though 
the type of competence is the same, the range of ope rations available on an application designed for the 
smartphone is much wider, and consequently, the understanding of the competence and the proficiency 
level required on a smartphone can be higher.  
  18 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
We observe in developing countries a wide gap between digital literacy assessment practices and how digital 
literacy competence is exhibited in the examples we collected. Assessments conducted by the three 
enterprise frameworks and in the context of some national frameworks (e.g. Chile and India) use standalo ne 
desktop computers, while everyday use scenarios requiring digital literacy competence, particularly those in 
developing countries, use almost exclusively mobile devices. Desktop computers are primarily used for 
workplace productivity, often in the conte xt of white -collar jobs. The most popular devices that are used by 
the majority of adults are mobile devices, such as mobile phones, smart phones, and tablets. Furthermore, 
irrespective of the device used, non -networked devices have very limited uses for e veryday purposes, except 
in schools and training institutions.  
The mapping of the examples to DigComp 2.0 competences listed in Table 1 (extended by an additional 
competence area, labelled as “0” for devices and software operations) was carried out for the  15 types of 
functions identified in the 20 cases (see Appendix 5).  The full results of the mapping are presented in 
Appendix 7 . While large differences do not exist in digital literacy skills through everyday transactions using 
a mobile phone which has no  Internet connectivity, important differences do exist between mobile phone 
and smart phone users that have implications for digital literacy: smart phone users can demonstrate three 
competences in digital operations which are not available to mobile phone  users (see Appendix 7).   
Another important finding is that, irrespective of the kind of device used, the functions required of users 
only covered 16 of the 22 competences listed. The six “missing” DigComp competences are also identified in 
some of the digital literacy frameworks we mapped (see Table 3),  including the U.S. National Educational 
Technology Standard (ISTE, 2016). The absence of these six competences in this mapping exercise suggests 
that they are not necessary or useful in everyday operations in a wide range of economic and developmental 
contexts. Furthermore, basic technical and interactive competences seem more necessary, and adding a 
competence area on devices and software operations indicates the importance of this area outside of 
developed  countries. Ultimately, we find that the technology and infrastructure available, as well as the 
sector, determine the digital literacy competences and proficiency levels that are important for that context.  
5. Pathways for digital literacy development an d assessment: An example 
application of a Digital Literacy Global Framework  
In developing the draft Digital Literacy Global Framework (DLGF) and in mapping the examples, the project 
team found that the specific digital literacy competences and proficiency  levels that are important depend 
on their specific country and economic sector contexts. The opportunities for a person to develop his/her 
digital competences also depend on their particular context. Nonetheless, in order to advance the use of 
digital tec hnology to enhance social and economic development, the necessary infrastructure and access 
need to be available in the community, in addition to the individual having the required level of digital 
literacy.  
Hence, in order that the DLGF can be a useful re source to guide digital literacy development and assessment 
for diverse country and sector contexts, the project team has developed a  pathway mapping methodology  to 
guide countries, sectors, groups and individuals to develop strategies and plans for advanc ing their own 
digital literacy development goals and pathways. A pathway for digital literacy development can be 
developed through comparing case examples for specific targeted contexts to identify the difference in 
digital literacy competences required fo r acceptable performance between the popular current use and the 19 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
use scenario to aspire to. Using this mapping methodology, stakeholders at different levels of the system in 
different country/sector/personal contexts can customise their own digital literac y development plan.  
We propose that designing curricula and assessments around case examples may be a more effective 
approach to address different country contexts. Defining digital literacy levels and assessments at the 
practical level by case examples, a nd not at the conceptual level in frameworks, results in a non -linear and 
contextualised approach.  
Appendix 8 presents a detailed pathway mapping methodology and includes two sample pathways based 
on agriculture (see Appendix  9) and e -government (see Appe ndix 10 ). Each pathway comprises competences 
and contexts using examples for countries at different levels of development. A pathway may involve more 
than one technology type or sector, which shows how digital literacy competences for employment, decent 
jobs and entrepreneurship are closely linked with a set of inter -related sectors and technologies. We find 
three possible types of progression in competences in such pathways: i) increasing the proficiency level for 
acceptable performance within the same com petence where more sophisticated digital devices or software 
systems are used; ii) the development of new competences; and iii) changes in the relative importance of 
specific competences due to changes in application areas or technology advances.  
6. Round s of consultation leading to a proposal for a Digital Literacy Global 
Framework skills  
Based on findings from the two mapping exercises reported above, we then conducted two consultation 
stages to arrive at a final proposal for the DLGF. Appendix 11  summa rises the proposed DLGF we used for 
the in -depth consultation. The resulting, modified framework used in the online consultation is presented in 
Appendix 12 . Detailed methodological notes for both consultation stages can be found in Appendix 13 , and 
detail ed findings from the analysis of the in -depth consultation and the online consultation can be found in  
Appendices 14 and 15 respectively.  
6.1 In -depth consultation methodology  
The first stage consisted of an in -depth consultation with digital literacy exp erts to validate the draft DLGF 
(see Appendix 11) , which was an extension of DigComp 2.0 based on the two mapping exercises reported 
earlier.  As DigComp is a framework developed to serve the needs of countries in Europe which are 
economically developed, it  is important that the final proposed framework covers countries at all levels of 
development. During the in -depth consultation, experts were invited to review the draft executive summary 
of the DLGF (see Appendix 16 ), followed by an online interview (see Appendix 17) to seek their feedback on 
the relevance of digital literacy in their local contexts and the suitability  of the proposed DLGF.  
Of the 97 invited participants, 15 experts completed the consultation, representing a coverage of at least 
two count ries from each six regions: Africa, Asia, the European Union, high -income nations outside of the 
European Union, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa (information about these 15 experts can 
be found in Appendix 18 .) The interviews with the e xperts were transcribed and analysed to address the 
research questions about the relevance of digital literacy and frameworks in the expert’s context, specific 
comments on the suitability and comprehensiveness of the proposed DLGF, as well as comments on t he 
usefulness and operationalisability of the proposed pathways mapping methodology.  20 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
6.2 In -depth consultation findings  
The interviewed experts generally welcomed the development of a DLGF. Also there is general agreement 
about the relevance of competence areas in the DigComp  2.0 framework. However, responses towards CA0 
(hardware and software) varied, some experts considered it irrelevant or redundant, while others saw its 
value in the immediate and medium term within their own contexts. CA6 (career -relate d competences) was 
considered too specialised by some experts although not much feedback was received on this point possibly 
due to it not being initially specified in the DLGF consultation document.  
A lot of useful feedback was received through the inter views. An expert in the European Union 
recommended making the language of the proposed competence areas and competences more consistent 
with the language used in DigComp by removing references to proficiency levels and specific digital 
technologies and mak ing use of Bloom’s taxonomy action verbs in the descriptions. Following this advice , 
competences in the relevant specialised field were included in CA6 and t he labels and competences for CAs 
0 and 6 were rewritten to align with the DigComp style.  
When aske d if there were any missing digital literacy competences to be added to the framework, the most 
cited missing competence (n=3) was computational thinking, which has increasingly gained wide global 
attention. While some may consider computational thinking t o be part of programming (competence 3.4), 
most of the current focus is on algorithmic thinking as an integral part of problem -solving competences in 
the digital world and not necessarily involving programming in specific computer languages. After 
discussi ons with experts, the project team decided to add computational thinking to the proposed 
framework as competence 5.5 for the online consultation.  
The experts considered the proposed pathway mapping methodology to be helpful to their countries and 
sectors i n identifying pathways for digital literacy development most suited to specific contexts and needs. 
They provided further examples of digital literacy applications in education, finance and e -government. They 
also foresaw difficulties and opportunities in implementing the pathway mapping methodology. While 
recognising the relevance of this methodology for high -income/urban contexts and small state contexts 
alike, its usefulness depends very much on the relevance and credibility of the case examples. Therefo re, for 
the purpose of the online consultation stage, an illustrative digital literacy pathway for e -government using 
a case example contributed by experts from Mauritius was added as a more relevant pathway for urban and 
high -income contexts.  
6.3 Online c onsultation methodology  
The second consultation stage was conducted as an online survey to solicit input from a larger number of 
stakeholders from different countries. For the online consultation, respondents were asked to review a short 
video presentatio n4 on the proposed DLGF before completing a 22 -item survey (see Appendix 19 ) on the 
competence areas and competences in the proposed DLGF, the pathway mapping methodology and 
background information about the respondent. To facilitate continuity and continu ed partnership in the 
validation process, experts invited to the in -depth consultation were also invited to the online consultation. 
To reach a broader group of stakeholders, the online consultation was promoted through social media and

research informatio n management systems (RIMs). The survey was open from 8 March 2018 to 8 April 2018 
and received 31 complete responses. The list of participants in the online consultation is found in 
Appendix  20. To capture and analyse diverse contexts, experts were catego rised according to geographical 
region and country income level. The profile of respondents according to World Bank income classifications 
is as follows:  
 High -income countries: 12  
 Upper -middle -income countries: 9  
 Lower -middle -income countries: 2  
 Multinatio nal, multi -income (either international or listed affiliation with more than one country and 
the countries are in different income groups): 8  
The profile of respondents according to geographic regions is:  
 Africa: 3  
 Asia: 7  
 European Union (including Central  Asia and former Soviet Union): 7  
 Latin America: 4  
 Multi -region (listed affiliation with countries in more than one region): 8  
 N/A (Australia and unclassified): 2  
6.4 Online consultation findings  
The online consultation survey results indicate that a major ity of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that 
all of the proposed competence areas and competences should be included in the DLGF, including the 
proposed additional competence areas CA0 and CA6, and their competences. Out of the seven proposed 
competen ce areas, CA6 received the least support.5 All of the lower -middle -income country respondents 
either agreed or strongly agreed to the inclusion of both CA0 and CA6. All disagreement or strong 
disagreement came from respondents in high -income or multi -natio nal or multi -income, multi -country 
contexts. Based on the open -ended survey responses received, we changed the label of competence 0.2 to 
clarify the focus on software, and we use the more contemporary term “devices” to replace “hardware” in 
the labels of CA0, competences 0.1 and 0.2.  
With regard to the proposed addition of competence 5.5, computational thinking, 45% and 26% of 
respondents respectively strongly agreed and agreed with the importance of its inclusion in the DLGF. All 
lower -middle -income count ry respondents (n=2) strongly agreed. All disagreement (n=4) came from 
respondents in high -income (n=3) or upper -middle -income (n=1) countries. The open -ended survey 
responses show that opposition to the inclusion of computational thinking  was associated w ith the 
respondent’s view that this is already included in competence 3.4 on programming.  
                                                                 
5 21 out of 31 responses either agreed or strongly agreed with the importance of the inclusion of CA6 and 
its competences in the DLGF.  22 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
16% and 61% of respondents respectively strongly agreed and agreed to the statement that the pathway 
mapping methodology provides a useful method to make use of the D LGF in a local or national context. 
However, only 10% and 42% of respondents strongly agreed and agreed respectively to the statement that 
the steps are easy to follow. The open -ended responses reveal that the small number of contexts presented 
in the exam ples limited the respondent’s ability to fully understand the pathway mapping methodology.  
6.5 Summary  
Based on the findings from both the in -depth and online consultations, the project team proposes a final 
version of the DLGF to the UIS for consideratio n. The proposed framework is summarised in Table  5, 
followed by a description of the competence areas and competences to add to what is currently covered in 
DigComp  2.0.   23 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2

 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
i) Competence area 0 - Devices and software operations  
Results from the consultation showed general agreement that a digital literacy framework should include 
competences needed for basic operations of devices and software, particularly in the context of low -income 
and developing countries . While competence 5.1 in DigComp 2.0 (solving technical problems) also involves 
the operation of devices and software, it refers to higher levels of understanding and skills involved in the 
problem -solving process.6  
The pr oposed addition of CA0 (Devices and software operations) comprises two additional competences, 0.1 
Physical operations of digital devices and 0.2  Software operations in digital devices.  
ii) Competence 5.5 - Computational thinking  
It is important to includ e computational thinking in the proposed framework as it is increasingly important 
that people have an understanding of the algorithmic, computational nature of problem -solving involving 
digital technology. Computational thinking is different from, though related to, the programming 
competence 3.4 under digital content creation. We propose to include computational thinking under CA5, 
problem -solving, to highlight that it is distinct from the ability to construct software programmes using set 
computer langua ges. 
iii) Competence area 6 - Career -related competences  
Some frameworks which target adults include career -specific competences, such as the use of digital 
technology in engineering (e.g. computer -aided design/computer -aided manufacturing equipment) and i n 
education (e.g. use of Learning Management Systems). As the objective of our proposed framework is to 
serve as the foundation for thematic Indicator 4.4.2 of SDG 4.4, we believe career -specific competences 
should be included and aligned with the proposed  Digital Literacy Pathway Mapping Methodology. 
Obviously, which career -specific knowledge, skills and attitudes should be included depends on the specific 
socioeconomic context, which also change over time. CA6, Career -related competences, is an addition t o 
DigComp 2.0, comprising competences 6.1 (Operating specialised digital technologies for a particular field) 
and 6.2 (Interpreting and manipulating data, information and digital content for a particular field). One 
advantage of the openness and flexibilit y for this competence area is that countries can identify the 
competences required for economic growth and development in targeted fields and in specific contexts.  
7. Recommendations for the next steps  
Results from research and the consultation processes show that there is wide recognition of the value of a 
global framework to guide the development of digital literacy . The majority of experts consulted agree on 
the proposed competence areas and competencese in the draft framework. Priorities in the field o f digital 
literacy will differ depending on socioeconomic contexts and the level of development of a country. The 
project team has proposed recommendations on how the proposed framework can guide digital literacy 
development in different country contexts a nd serve as the basis for the development of indicators for  
SDG 4.4.2.  
                                                                 
6 Defined as “to identify technical problems when operating devices and us ing digital environments, and to 
solve them (from trouble -shooting to solving more complex problems)”.  27 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
7.1 Digital literacy assessment instruments and indicators  
There are numerous instruments that have been developed by national, regional, international and 
commercial agencies for asse ssing digital literacy or digital competence. Based on our mapping of cross -
national and national lCT and digital literacy frameworks in Section 3, we found that the competences 
described in these frameworks can all be mapped to the DigComp 2.0 framework. Hence, we are confident 
that these instruments can be mapped to the proposed DLGF.  
The digital literacy assessment instruments that exist have been developed to serve different purposes, from 
certification to evaluation of individuals or population groups,  to research, etc. Carretero, Vuorikari and 
Punie (2016) conducted a comprehensive review of 22 assessment instruments and catergorised them into 
four major categories: performance assessment, knowledge -based assessment, self -assessment and 
secondary data -gathering and analysis. Performance assessment requires the individual to demonstrate 
how he/she performs certain tasks, while knowledge -based assessment requires the individual to explain 
how he/she would perform certain tasks. Self -assessments are subjec tive evaluations of one’s own 
competence and may not really reflect a person’s competence in real -life situations. Secondary data -
gathering and analysis may provide some information about competence at the group or population level 
but not at the individua l level. For certification or comparison of digital literacy achievements (such as in the 
International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013 and 2018), performance assessment is the 
instrument of choice.  
However, there is not a one -size-fits-all assessment of digital competence that can serve all purposes and 
contexts, and performance assessments may not necessarily provide indicators that are relevant for every 
context. For instance, the European Computer Driving License (ECDL) and International C omputer Driving 
License (ICDL), which are used in many developing countries, assess digital competence using standalone 
desktop computers which are not connected to the Internet. But digital technology use in these countries, 
as shown in case examples in S ection 4, involve almost entirely of networked mobile devices such as mobile 
phones, smart phones and tablets. Therefore, assessment indicators and instruments need to be mapped 
to the DLGF framework and include the context of usage and assessment purpose for them to be relevant 
and useful. As an example, assessments on a standalone desktop computer cannot address whether a 
farmer can use his/her mobile phone to conduct trading transactions for his produce but can be used to 
assess programming skills unrela ted to network operations.  
7.2 Development of global digital literacy indicators should be supported by cost -effective cross -
national R&D programmes  
Context -sensitive and fit -for-purpose digital literacy indicators and assessment instruments can possibly be 
most effectively generated through a process of research and consultation that identify examples of DLGF 
implementation suited to the needs of the target stakeholders through the pathway mapping methodology 
described in Section 5 at country/sector level s. The proposed DLGF could serve as a lever for scaffolding 
inter -organizational coordination and collaboration in the enhancement of digital literacy  development. In 
particular, collaboration on the implementation of the pathway mapping methodology to gen erate digital 
literacy training and assessment programs may provide a fertile context for collaboration among entities in 
diverse socio -political and economic contexts without the prior establishment of a common DL framework 
among the collaborating agencie s.  28 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
7.3 Proficiency levels and case examples for digital literacy frameworks  
Thematic Indicator 4.4.2 focuses on a minimum level of proficiency in digital literacy skills. DigComp  1.0 
differentiates four levels of proficiency and DigComp 2.1 differentiates  eight levels of proficiency along three 
aspects (complexity of tasks, autonomy and cognitive domain). Most digital literacy frameworks reviewed in 
this report do not specify proficiency levels for competences and therefore do not provide minimum levels.  
We recommend that digital literacy frameworks should include descriptions of proficiency so that they can 
provide better information on performance, which is necessary for the development of training 
programmes, monitoring and assessment. The three aspects  of proficiency in DigComp 2.1 are useful in 
providing a clear framework for conceptualising proficiency levels.  
Proficiency level specifications are only meaningful to the extent that these can be clearly understood by the 
targeted stakeholders. Furtherm ore, while different levels of proficiency can be defined in a general 
framework, what serves as an adequate level of proficiency differs according to the context. Our mapping 
exercises demonstrate that not all competences may be necessary. Hence, the deve lopment of proficiency 
level specifications should also be prioritised according to the context. The findings show that some 
competences are more relevant to a broader range of socioeconomic conditions and the minimum 
proficiency level can be determined ba sed on the specific context. We recommend using a case example 
mapping methodology to identify the required levels of proficiency for adequate performance in select 
examples for targeted stakeholders. We further recommend that cross -national collaboration be forged in 
the development of proficiency levels and case examples of use.  
7.4 Indicators for digital literacy to monitor progress towards SDG 4.4  
To meet SDG 4.4 to “substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, includ ing 
technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship”, data need to be 
available in order to track progress and establish baselines. The aim of this project is to propose a definition 
and a global competence framework for d igital literacy skills to underpin the development of Indicator 4.4.2. 
The framework would serve as a guide to monitor, assess and further develop digital literacy across 
countries at all stages of development. The associated indicators should also serve d ifferent national 
contexts and be developed through cross -national collaborations.  
8. Conclusion  
Experts and stakeholders across diverse economic and regional contexts have generally agreed on the 
proposed Global Framework for Digital Literacy and pathway  mapping methodology. Our findings show that 
the DigComp 2.0 framework is a valuable and suitable basis for the development of a global digital literacy 
framework.  
Countries have approached digital literacy in varying ways conceptually and in practice. Th e DigComp 2.0 
competence framework addresses contexts in European countries, which are typically high -income and 
technologically -developed. . To cater for different country needs on a global scale, the proposed framework 
has added competences, such as CA0,  Devices and software operations, and CA6, Career -related 
competences, as well as competence 5.5, Computational thinking.  29 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
The proposed framework and pathway mapping methodology can serve as a foundation for thematic 
Indicator 4.4.2 and the development of digital literacy frameworks, curricula and assessments across 
different countries and regions. We hope that the report will provide a solid foundation for further 
development of digital literacy to contribute towards the achieve ment of SDG 4.4.

Note: It is possible that given a higher number of examples or the inclusion of more economic sectors for 
this study, we could find new functions beyond the current list.  
 
In examining the functions , a user may need to manipulate in these 20 use examples, w e find three situations 
in terms of device dependence:  
1. There is no substantive difference between these two types of devices for function ing – there are 
two functions that fall into this category: turning on/off and charging the device (GG1)  and sending 
and receiving text messages (G2).  
2. The same function can be performed on both types of devices, but the functionality and proficienc y 
levels required are different – there are also two functions that fall into this category: device and 
account management (G3 M & G3S, login, user account and password management, locking devices), 
and searching and comparing information (G4M & G4S).  
3. Some functions are only available for a specific type of device. Two of the functions are only used by 
mobile phone users: buyer an d seller interaction connected through an intermediary, and topping 
up one’s account through an agent. These are two financial transactions that have to be conducted 
through an intermediary even though digital communication devices are being used, as the d evices 
are not Internet enabled. There are four generic functions (G5S, G6S, G7S, G8S) and three financial 
transactions (T3S, T4S, T5S) that are only available through an Internet -enabled device such as a 
smartphone.

Since the DL competence required in the use examples in the six selected sectors relate only to the 
functions that are independent of the sector, the mapping of the use examples to competences are not 
carrie d out directly, but between the functions listed in Table 6 and the DigComp competences listed in 
Table 1 (extended by an additional competence area, labelled as “0” for hardware and software 
operations). The following are examples of such mapping to illus trate how this process is conducted:  
 G1 (turning on/off & charging device) requires competence in hardware and software operations . 
 G4M & G4S (searching for goods & services & comparing prices) requires all three competences 
under the Information and data literacy area, and competences 2.3 ( Engaging in citizenship 
through digital technologies) and 4.3 ( Protecting health and well -being) . 
 G7S (creating & setting public profile) requires competences in 2.2 (sharing through digital 
technologies), 2.6 (managing digital identity), 3.1 (developing digital content), and 4.2 (protecting 
personal data and privacy) . 
 Both T4S and T5S (intra -app and inter -app financial transactions respectively) require the same 
set of competences, but to different levels of proficiency in terms of the complexities involved in 
accessing, evaluating and managing the information (1.1, 1.2 & 1.3) and in identifying needs and 
technological responses (5.2) in the decision -making process.

Appendix 8. Pathway mapping methodology examples and g uide  
Introduction  
 
In developing the draft Digital Literacy Global Framework (DLGF), the project team found that the specific 
digital literacy competences and proficiency levels that are important to adults depend importantly on 
their specific country and economic sector contexts. Furthermore, their priorities for advancing their 
digital competence also depend on the broader developmental priorities they found themselves in. 
Hence, in order that the DLGF can be a useful resource to guide digital literacy de velopment and 
assessment for diverse country and sector developmental contexts, the project team has developed a 
pathway mapping methodology  to guide countries, sectors, groups and individuals to develop strategies 
and plans for advancing their own digital  literacy development goals and pathways. Here, we provide a 
brief description of the methodology.  
 
A pathway for digital literacy development can be developed through comparing use case examples for 
specific targeted contexts to identify the difference in  digital literacy competence required for adequate 
performance between the popular current use example and the use example to aspire to. The ability to 
advance the use of digital technology to enhance social and economic development depends not only 
on the  availability of the necessary infrastructure and technology access in the community, but also a 
higher level of digital literacy. Using this mapping methodology, stakeholders at different levels of the 
system in different country/sector/personal contexts can customize their own digital literacy 
development plan.  
Use Case Example Comparison Tables for Two Economic Areas  
Tables 1 and 2 compare the dimensions, competences and proficiency required for adequate 
performance for use cases. Table 1 compares three use case examples in agriculture, showing different 
levels of sophistication in the deployment of technology to enhance the productivity and profit of 
farmers. Table 2 compares two use cases in government, showing different levels of sophistication in the 
deployment of technology to enhance the productivity of entrepreneurs and bidders in government 
systems. The examples in both tables are numbered for a progression or pathway.  
Table 1 shows the pathway of progression in competences required of the farmer i f he/she wants to 
move from a less to a more sophisticated use of technology in the farming case examples. We can see a 
pathway in terms of digital technology used, from a basic mobile phone, to a smart phone, to an 
automated watering system that can be re motely monitored and activated. We can also see a pathway 
in software required from user -end software to back -end software.  
Table 2  shows the different competences required of a person if he/she wants to move/extend his/her 
business from one country to ano ther, in order to be able to use the relevant e -government services. E -
government systems differ in terms of the nature of the services offered, the connectivity of the system 
across different government departments, and whether specific digital devices ar e needed for 
identification verification. We can see a pathway in terms of the complexity of the task, from registering 
to have a login to use a government service to using a specific government service, which includes the 
registering and signing into the service. We can also see a pathway in terms of the complexity of the 
software features and functionalities provided by the e -services portal.  62

 68 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
Three possible types of progression in competences are observed in pathways of increasing sophistication 
in technology use:  
1. Increasing proficiency level for adequate performance within the same competence . This could  arise from 
the use of more sophisticated digital devices. In the three examples of Table 1, under competence 
0.1 concerning the physical operations of digital technologies, the farmer in example 1 needs to use 
a mobile phone, which may have fewer physical  features and pairing possibilities with other digital 
devices than a smartphone which the farmer uses in example 2. The use of the data -driven irrigation 
system in example 3 requires the farmer's organization and use of many individual parts. Increasing 
proficiency level for adequate performance within the same competence could also arise from the 
use of more sophisticated software on digital devices. In the two examples of Table 2, under 
competence 0.2, while the entrepreneur in example 1 uses more digita l technologies, the bidder in 
example 2 uses a software system with more sophisticated requirements and capabilities, including 
interacting with different types of files on the e -Procurement System and the bidder's system.  
2. The need to develop new competenc es. For instance, in Table 1, example 1 does not require 
competences 0.2 (basic knowledge of account management), 2.2 (sharing information on the 
internet), and 5.2 (identify needs and technological responses that are immediately useful).   
3. The immediate im portance of specific competences may be less important because of the 
application area, and necessarily because of the sophistication of the technology used. For instance, 
in Table 1 example 2, since the application focus is to help the farmer make more ef ficient and 
profitable sales, competence 3.1 (developing digital content) becomes an immediately important 
competence. In Table 2 example 2, since the application focus is to help the bidder make bids within 
the e -procurement system, competence 1.2 (evalua ting data, information and digital content) 
becomes an immediately important competence.  
 
The proposed pathways can be adapted for different developmental contexts and ICT availability. These can 
be further elaborated for different roles in a specific econ omic sector. For example, agricultural development 
in some African countries will definitely benefit if farmers and traders with mobile phones can use the RML 
Farmer app and Trader app effectively, with support from community knowledge workers in agricultu re with 
smart phones. This model of integrating DL development with local/national developmental state and 
priorities would be immediately meaningful and motivating for those involved, and bring tangible benefits.  
Limitations  
It is important to note severa l limitations to this pathway mapping methodology. First, by using cases to 
develop a pathway, individual users may view a use case as too particularistic or irrelevant, dismissing a case, 
and not drawing salient analytical generalizations from the case to  the user’s experience. Second, the 
example pathways in this report are illustrations of the methodology and not an attempt to capture all 
different contexts and use case scenarios. We do not know what pathways may be developed with all 
possible use cases,  job areas and sectors. Third, the pathway mapping methodology is clearly not conducive 
to traditional forms of DL assessment, which generally has been decontextualized, high -stakes, desktop -
based assessment, when that type of assessment may be a meaningfu l approach to advance DL 
development in some contexts. Fourth, the methodology may suffer looser interpretation of competences, 69 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
adequate performance for competences and other DL -concepts as it is implemented in multi -stakeholder, 
multi -level contexts.  
DLGF  and pathway mapping methodology to scaffolding inter -organizational coordination and 
collaboration  
While the pathway mapping methodology focuses on identifying the specific competences required for 
different digital technology use scenarios in the immedia te, medium and longer term, the results of the 
mapping have different implications for different stakeholders in the use context. The stakeholder can be 
individuals, communities, institutions, NGOs, national or international organizations. For instance, Ta ble 3 
shows different possible decisions and implications for the illustrative agriculture pathway in this report 
based on stakeholder group. Taking the agriculture pathway as an example, the implications for an individual 
farmer is different from an NGO s erving farmers in supporting them to increase their productivity through 
technology use, and different for policy makers in the Ministry of Agriculture.

One important use of the global framework and pathway mapping methodology is to serve as a scaffold ing 
framework for different organizations that serve the same target community to coordinate and collaborate 
to better support the target community that they serve. This can take the form of multi -level collaboration 
such as between national, sub -national and individual levels; or multi -stage collaboration such as between 
the many groups that serve refugees at different stages of refugee migration from displacement to re -
settlement; and intra -level collaboration such as between empowerment programs for unde rserved 
communities.  
The first step in this collaborative process is to identify the targeted use case scenarios. Once the use case 
scenarios are selected, the mapping can be done by identifying the hardware and software technologies to 
be used, the key a ctions, interactions and transactions required, and then the DL competence for performing 
those operations. Taking as an example intra -level collaboration between NGOs that server farmers in the 
same context, NGOs may work together to convince farmers that  digital technology and DL are relevant to 
their everyday work, to research existing practices and available digital technologies for use cases, and 
develop the modes and use case media for training farmers.  70

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the DLGF  and Pathway Mapping Methodology  
About DLGF  
1. Does the numbering of competence areas and competences indicate a progression?  
a. No, the numbering of the competence areas and the number sequencing of competences 
within a competence area do not indicate a progre ssion. They are just used to provide a 
convenient way for referencing.  
2. How can my organization make use of the digital literacy global framework?  
 
The DLGF is intended to serve as a framework of reference for different stakeholders, and the specific 
use d iffers according to the purpose. Some examples include:  
 
a. To create educational programs for a target population, for example to meet the needs of 
developing digital literacy programs for the implementation of a national digital strategy.  
b. For further resear ch and development in order to improve the digital literacy of a target 
population/sector  
c. As a reference tool to compare against existing digital literacy frameworks/curricula. You can 
read about the mapping of selected digital literacy frameworks onto th e extended DigComp 
framework in the draft DLGF report . You can read about a specific example of a curriculum 
being mapped to DigComp here .  
d. As a reference tool to develop a digital literacy implementation plan. You can read about 
specific implementation examples of a digital literacy framework in the DigComp Gallery of 
Implementation within European Union member states . 
3. How does digital literacy relate to digital citizenship, if at all?   
a. Digital literacy serves as the competence needed for citizens to exercise thei r rights and 
responsibilities in the digital world, which is not confined to geopolitical boundaries. As 
Ferrari (2013) states, “The competences and competence areas that are here defined can be 
seen as components of e -citizenship, thereby addressing the i ssue of digital divide. It is in 
fact recognized that participation in the digital domain is no longer a question of "have" or 
"have not", but rather an issue of competence” (p. 7).  
4. Are there overlaps in the competences listed in the DLGF?   
a. Yes, some compe tences overlap and are interconnected .  (For cross -references between 
competences, please see Annex II of Ferrari’s (2013) DIGCOMP: A Framework for Developing 
and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe, or section 4.2 of Vuorikari, Punie, Carretero 
and Van den Brande’s (2016) DigComp 2.0: The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens 
Update Phase 1: The Conceptual Reference Model ) The goal of this project is to propose a global 
competence framework of digital literacy skills that is sensitive to differe nt developmental 
contexts. The categorization prioritizes the recognizability and ease of use of the framework 
by different stakeholders. A consequence of this context -sensitivity is making visible 
competence areas and competences that might otherwise be m issed by stakeholders, 
particularly those in developing contexts, if embedded within other competence areas and 71 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
competences. Thus, it was seen necessary to have additional, standalone competence areas 
0 and 6, and competence 5.5 computational thinking.  
5. Why is the language used to describe the competence areas and competences so broad? Would it 
not be better if more specific language is used?  
a. Broad or generic language in the description of competence areas and competences is 
appropriate for the global frame work to ensure that it is relevant for diverse contexts and 
remain so over time. Stakeholders can make adaptations to generate their own DL 
frameworks as appropriate for their own contexts by using more specific language.  
6. Where can I find more information about the terms used in each competence?  
a. Please refer to the DLGF competence descriptors and glossary  on the project website.  
About pathway mapping methodology  
1. Is it your plan to es tablish a pathway mapping model for every potential sector in every potential 
job-related area?  
a. No, the example pathways are illustrations of the methodology. There are many different 
contexts and use case scenarios, and the project will not attempt to de velop a collection. The 
methodology is to be adopted by relevant stakeholders who will develop their own pathway 
for their respective sectors and job -related areas.  
2. Do all the use case examples come from large states?  
a. No, the use case examples on the webs ite come from large and small states. The use case 
examples on the website are illustrative as proof of concept that any state can develop use 
cases and adopt the methodology.  
3. Who should use the pathway mapping methodology?  
a. Anyone can select their own use  cases as considered relevant and use this method to serve 
the purpose for which they wish to conduct the mapping.  On the other hand, we can see that 
the most likely adopters of this methodology are those involved in the provision of DL 
training and those in positions serving policy makers.

4. Brief description of use example (up to 150 words):  Farmers’ decisions on which crops to plant, and 
where to sell their produce have significant impact on their profits. An Indian farmer uses a mobile phone 
service to  increase his agricultural yields and profits. He receives four to five text messages daily about short 
and long -term weather forecasts, market prices of different produce, and effective farmer practices. He can 
make decisions on which crops to grow. He ca n also sell his produce directly using the market information 
obtained, without using the services traditionally provided by middlemen who take crops to the market, thus 
increasing his income. He can also personalize his texts to receive information about particular crops and 
particular markets. He often shares information with fellow farmers in person or by forwarding texts using 
his mobile phone, which he carries all the time.  
5. Economic area of this use example:  Agriculture  
6. Role(s) of the person(s) u sing the digital technology:  Farmer  
7. Digital technology used:  Mobile phone with voice call and SMS capability  
8. Software applications (if applicable):  Not applicable  
9. Purpose(s) for digital technology use:  A farmer with adequate digital literacy and a ccess to the RML 
service can make better decisions at each crop cycle, including what to grow and where to sell his crops. He 
will have an advantage over other farmers.  
10. Key actions/interactions/transactions in use example:  
10a. Actions (without involvi ng other parties):  A farmer charges his mobile phone and turns it on. The 
farmer can carry his phone while working. A farmer uses RML service on his mobile phone to receive SMS 
information about weather, market prices and farming practices. The farmer rece ives four to five 
personalized SMS messages each day. The farmer can compare prices in different markets and decide on a 
market to sell his product on a particular day. The farmer can organize and delete the SMS messages on the 
phone.  
10b. Interactions (wi th other parties):  The farmer can call other farmers and show information to other 
farmers.  
10c. Transactions (materials/money exchanged with others):  Not applicable  
11. Additional comments and use example implications:  Agricultural competition is fierce i n India as 
there are millions of farmers, and millions more people are expected to become farmers. Digital literacy and 
technology for each farmer can help boost national income, increase agricultural yields and entice more 
young people to become farmers. India has cheap voice and text plans and needs sufficient basic mobile 
phone infrastructure for all.

http://www.agromarketday.com  
4. Brief description of use example (up to 150 words): Ugandan farmers depend on mark et days at 
specific times and places to sell product. Market days create additional costs for farmers in terms of storing 
product for market days, transporting product to markets, and using middlemen to bring product to 
markets. Besides, a farmer may not b e able to sell all his product on a market day. A smartphone app that 
connects buyers and sellers directly to decide on price, place, date and time of delivery, eliminates 
middlemen and physical markets, and may impact farmers’ profits. The farmer takes pi ctures of his product, 
and uploads that with price, location and a phone number to the app. A buyer scrolls through product listing 
in the application and if he wants to buy a particular product, he calls the seller to arrange the transaction. 
The farmer c an also post product advertisements for fellow farmers who do not have smart phones.  
5. Economic area of this use example: Agriculture  
6. Role(s) of the person(s) using the digital technology: Farmer  
7. Digital technology used: A smartphone with Internet c onnectivity  
8. Software applications (if applicable): Agro Market Day  
9. Purpose(s) for digital technology use: A farmer with adequate digital literacy and access to Agro Market 
Day can lower costs and reduce reliance on middlemen and physical marketplaces  to buy and to sell product. 
By finding price information from several marketplaces and by posting advertisements, the farmer widens 
his marketplaces even internationally to buy and sell product. He will have an advantage over other farmers 
who primarily r ely on physical, local marketplaces and middlemen to buy and sell product.  
10. Key actions/interactions/transactions in use example:  
10a. Actions (without involving other parties):  A farmer charges his smart phone and turns it on. The 
farmer can carry his phone while working. A farmer finds and downloads the Agro Market Day app from the 
Android store. The farmer registers and logs in with a phone number and password. The farmer takes 
pictures of his product, and uploads that with price, location and a phone  number to the app. A farmer can 
search for a particular product in the app and view listings. The farmer can also browse agricultural news, 
view recommendations for where to buy genuine agricultural tools and inputs (herbicides; pesticides; 
fertilizers; e tc.), and can access price information from several marketplaces.  
  75 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
10b. Interactions (with other parties):  A buyer can call a seller and arrange time, date and location for 
transaction. A farmer with a smartphone can cooperate with a farmer without a smartp hone to post produce 
advertisements on the app for the farmer without a smartphone. The farmer with the smartphone can 
cooperate with the farmer without a smartphone and a buyer to transact.  
10c. Transactions (materials/money exchanged with others):  Buyers  and sellers exchange product and 
money at an agreed upon date, time and location.  
11. Additional comments and use example implications: The government intends agri -business to 
become a major export for Uganda. Digital literacy and technology for each farm er can help boost national 
income and exports, and entice more young people to become farmers. However, existing physical 
marketplace practices may discourage farmers from buying and selling, and discourage others from 
becoming farmers. In addition, many U gandans are farmers but the majority of Uganda’s farmers are 
peasants who do not own smart phones. Uganda needs sufficient smart phone saturation and Internet data 
infrastructure to support widespread farmer smart phone use.

2. Media upload to use example photos and articles:  
3. Links to use example videos, articles and photos:  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiNLdOPoX8oZbyD7ORWJSSld7uHUbjM5  
4. Brief description of use  example (up to 150 words): In the irrigation cycle, farmers need to regularly 
water their crops and need to manually inspect crops for moisture or use rudimentary tools to check 
moisture and then gauge the amount of water to add to crops. In addition, peo ple who would like to farm 
part-time need time -saving automation. Climate change makes forecasting moisture levels more challenging 
and no existing scheduled irrigation services based on soil moisture exist in the market. Farmers can save 
water, money and time by building an automatic watering system based on soil conditions. A farmer needs 
pumps and tanks, moisture sensors planted in soil, wires and transmitters, and a program. A farmer can 
program when to release water or other inputs, based on time or mo isture sensor data. A farmer can 
conserve water for others and recoup the cost of the infrastructure shortly by saving on water costs. A farmer 
can substitute fertilizer for water in an irrigation cycle.  
5. Economic area of this use example: Agriculture  
6. Role(s) of the person(s) using the digital technology: Farmer  
7. Digital technology used: Arduino program; USB plug; moisture sensors; wires and transmitters; power 
supply; (water) tank supply sensor; relay; clock; LCD display; laptop  
8. Software applicat ions (if applicable): Arduino program  
9. Purpose(s) for digital technology use: A farmer with adequate digital literacy and access to maker tools 
can lower costs by reducing manpower and water in the irrigation cycle. The farmer becomes less reliant on 
weather forecasting information. The farmer can recoup costs from an automated irrigation system within 
months, and save water for other people. He will have an advantage over farmers who do not have 
immediate and precise data on moisture levels in their soil , who rely on weather forecasts and who rely on 
manpower for irrigation. The farmer expands the Arduino community for rapid, open -source prototyping.  
10. Key actions/interactions/transactions in use example:  
10a. Actions (without involving other parties):  The farmer needs to purchase appropriate parts. The 
farmer can follow a connection diagram to assemble irrigation system parts. The farmer needs to plug in 
Arduino into a laptop via USB and install software. The farmer can define constants on the programmi ng 
interface, pins, the maximum dryness, and the water delay and water post -delay. The farmer can further 
setup pins on the programming interface. The farmer can program a loop to read sensor value, compare it, 
and to take action with water and delay if th e soil is too dry. The farmer can refer to sample code in Arduino 
to learn to program. The farmer can place sensors at appropriate depth in soil and locations in field, and 
place watering devices at appropriate height and location. The farmer can properly power the system and 78 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
read its setting on an LCD display, or on a laptop. The farmer can reprogram the system to irrigate based on 
time, or to irrigate based on fertilizer not water.  
10b. Interactions (with other parties):  The farmer can reach out to the Ar duino online community to learn 
to program and to troubleshoot programs, and to Arduino farming community to learn appropriate ways to 
physically connect an irrigation system and to program it.  
10c. Transactions (materials/money exchanged with others):  
11. Additional comments and use example implications: Building an automated irrigation system is 
constrained by the supply of irrigation system parts, and reliable energy to power the system. Automated 
irrigation seems to work best on small plots and requires  greater network connectivity and infrastructure 
investment to monitor a large field.

4. Brief description of use example (up to 150 words): The government of Mauritius’s public bodies 
require suppliers. Previously, t he process of procurement through invitations for bids, bidding and awarding 
and reporting was offline and was time -consuming and not cost effective. The government of Mauritius has 
required its public bodies to post all procurement needs in an e -procureme nt system and its possible 
suppliers to view and make bids through the system, saving time, reducing costs and increasing 
transparency. With a compatible system, a bidder to become a government supplier can create a user 
account and register his organizati on in the e -procurement system. The bidder can search and view all 
government invitations for bids, download and upload documents and digital certificates to make bids, and 
complete bid forms in the e -procurement system. The person can also review and revi se bids after 
submission.  
5. Economic area of this use example: Government  
6. Role(s) of the person(s) using the digital technology: Bidder for government supplier  
7. Digital technology used: PC or laptop; Internet connectivity  
8. Software applications (if  applicable): Compatible Windows operating system; Office software; 
compatible Internet browser; Java; Adobe Acrobat Reader; digital signature certificate; anti -virus software; 
https://eproc.pu blicprocurement.govmu.org/login  
9. Purpose(s) for digital technology use: The Government of Mauritius has been keen to move towards e -
procurement in line with its philosophy of sustainable of sustainable procurement. In addition, e -
procurement reduces pro curement costs and time for the government and is a transparent mechanism for 
possible suppliers to view all public body procurement needs, reports and awards.  
10. Key actions/interactions/transactions in use example:  
10a. Actions (without involving other parties):  The bidder needs to turn on a computer, open a web 
browser, and go to the Government of Mauritius e -Procurement System website. From the landing page, the 
person can scan and skim the content in the How to?, FAQ, Help Desk, and Standard Bidding D ocs sections 
of the website to find relevant information on successful making a bid. He/she can also search YouTube and 
other websites to find relevant information. The person needs to check the prerequisite hardware and 
software system requirements agains t the person's hardware and software system. In addition, he/she 
needs to respond to the website and web browser prompts and to unblock content, to allow pop -up 
windows, and to install a Java utility on the bidder’s system.  81 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
The bidder needs to create a use r account for his organization in the e -Procurement system first by clicking

4. Brief description of use example (up to 150 words): Entrepreneurs in Dubai need to use government 
services. Previously, when engaging government services online, entrepreneurs would waste time to create 
a username and password for each government service and to recall a username and passw ord for a service. 
The government of Dubai has established MyID, a single sign -on comprising one username and password 
to access over 600 government services on websites and apps. By using a MyID, entrepreneurs can save 
time and conveniently access require d government services, for instance, to obtain a business licence, obtain 
a tenancy contract and register company vehicles. An entrepreneur registers for a MyID with his fingerprint, 
and a physical Emirates ID card with a PIN code to access information on the ID. The person registers at a 
kiosk or at a computer with a smart card reader. He/she inputs email address, password, mobile phone 
number and ID number on the registration form.  
5. Economic area of this use example: Government  
6. Role(s) of the person( s) using the digital technology: Entrepreneur  
7. Digital technology used: Emirates ID card; kiosk or PC or laptop with smart -card reader; mobile or smart 
phone; Internet connectivity  
8. Software applications (if applicable):  Internet browser; government se rvice apps  
9. Purpose(s) for digital technology use: The government of Dubai has a Smart Dubai vision to make Dubai 
the happiest city on Earth, and the MyID is an initiative to realize this vision through technological innovation. 
The government of Dubai a lso facilitates entrepreneurship, reduces paper reliance and physical visits to 
government departments.  
10. Key actions/interactions/transactions in use example:  
10a. Actions (without involving other parties):  An entrepreneur needs to keep a physical Emira tes ID card 
and set and recall a PIN to access information from the card. The person needs to visit a kiosk within the city 
to register or if the person doesn’t want to visit a kiosk, the person needs to turn on a computer, attach a 
smart card reader, open  a web browser, and input the webpage to register. He/she needs to insert the 
Emirates ID properly into the kiosk or the smart card reader. On the registration webpage, the person 
identifies the options to change language and to find more information, incl uding kiosk locations through

Appendix 13. Methodological notes from DLGF consultation stages  
In-depth c onsultation  
The fir st consultation stage in developing the proposed extensions to DigComp 2.0 was an in -depth 
consultation with a select and representative group of experts from different parts of the world. The 
objective of the first consultation stage was to validate the m ethodological ap proach for extending 
DigComp  2.0 from a high -income country, Euro -centric framework to a proposed global framework; and to 
enrich the proposed global framework, particularly with more use examples.  
The in -depth consultation comprised a pre view phase and an interview phase. For the preview phase, we 
developed a draft executive summary of the DLGF for participants to read. Participants were asked to take 
notes and if possible to send their comments and questions to the research team before th e interview phase. 
For the interview phase, we developed an interview protocol  comprising 11 questions about 1) DL 
requirements and conditions for youths and adults in participants’ local contexts, and about DL frameworks 
in the local contexts; 2) views on  the proposed DLGF framework competence areas and competences; 3) 
views on the proposed pathway mapping methodology in the framework to guide countries, sectors, groups 
and individuals to develop strategies and plans for advancing their own DL development goals and 
pathways. The interview questions were piloted for clarity and for a 45 -minute timing. They were sent to 
experts for their preview upon confirmation of in -depth consultation participation. The interviews were 
conducted over VOIP software and vide o-recorded with the option of only audio -recording.  
An expert list was developed of 97 possible candidates for the in -depth consultation. Experts constitute the 
categories of UIS GAML members, associates recommended from the UIS GAML members and the proje ct 
team, authors and other participants in developing the DL frameworks collected for the mapping of DL 
frameworks, people and companies associated with the use examples collected for the project, authors of 
DL research literature collected for the mapping  of use examples. The sample of expert participants were 
further categorized by country and region to target for the in -depth consultation at least two experts from 
two countries from six regions: Africa; Asia; EU; High -income nations outside the EU; Latin  America; and 
Middle East and North Africa. Contact information of emails and social media handles for the experts was 
found through online searches when necessary. A letter explaining the consultation stage and inviting 
experts to participate was sent to candidates, and a reminder letter was sent to candidates with no response 
to the initial letter. Of the 24 people who had agreed to participate, 13 interviews were conducted with 15 
people. The list of interviewees for the in -depth consultation can be foun d in the Appendix.  
The contents of experts’ responses were analyzed per interview question, and by country, to identify 
consensus, and recurring and outlying concerns which the project team could evaluate and address in 
further developing the proposed fra mework’s competence areas and competences, and the pathway 
mapping methodology, for the global level. The findings of the analysis can be found in the Appendix.  
Online c onsultation  
The second consultation stage in developing the proposed extensions to DigC omp was an online 
consultation with the objective to finalize the proposed extensions to DigComp in view of revisions based on 
the in -depth consultation responses, and through a large number of experts from different countries.  91 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
For the online consultation , we developed a short presentation on the proposed DLGF, and a 22 -item survey, 
to seek experts’ feedback on the competence areas and competences in the proposed DLGF, the pathway 
mapping methodology, and some information about each expert and the expert’s  organization. Experts 
could refer to the presentation and resources on the website when completing the survey. Regarding survey 
items for the CAs and competences in the proposed DLGF, experts were asked to respond through five -point 
Likert scale items abo ut the clarity of the competences and CAs in general, and the importance of including 
each CA and its competences, including the proposed CA0 and CA6 extensions to the existing DigComp 2.0 
CAs. Experts were asked to respond specifically to the importance o f the proposed computational thinking 
competence. They were also asked to respond to the proposed definition of digital competence, comprising 
knowledge, skills and attitude. Each Likert scale item included an open response section for additional 
comments.  Furthermore, through an open response item, experts were given an opportunity to suggest any 
missing competence to the proposed framework. Regarding the pathway mapping methodology, experts 
were asked to respond through five -point Likert scale items about  the usefulness and ease of use of the 
pathway mapping methodology and use cases in the respondent’s context. Through an open response item, 
experts were given an opportunity to suggest any use cases for pathway mapping from their local context. 
Regarding experts’ organizational information, experts were asked multiple choice questions about the 
nature of their organizations, and their organizations’ interest in using the DLGF. Through open response 
items, experts were also asked about their roles in their organizations and the countries which their 
organizations represent.  
To facilitate continuity and continued partnership in the validation process, expert participants of the in -
depth consultation were invited by email to participate in the online consulta tion. The expert candidates 
who were invited to the in -depth consultation were also invited by email to participate in the online 
consultation. To reach a broader and more numerous group of stakeholders beyond the in -depth 
consultation sample, the online c onsultation was promoted through the social media of Twitter and 
Facebook, and the research information management systems (RIMs) of Academia.edu, LinkedIn and 
Researchgate. The online consultation was promoted through the research teams’ personal social m edia 
and RIM accounts, and the UIS GAML social media account. To reach DL experts and practitioners, within 
Facebook, the online consultation invitation was posted to groups directly related to the DL frameworks 
found in this report, and found through a Fa cebook group search using the term, “digital literacy”. It was also 
posted on Facebook to ICT in education practitioner groups known to the research team. Within Twitter, the 
online consultation invitation was posted to the digital literacy hashtag and rel ated hashtags found within 
tweets with the digital literacy hashtag. It was also posted on Twitter to ICT in education practitioner hashtags 
known to the research team. DL experts known to the research team or UIS GAML were personally invited 
to the online  consultation through email. The complete list of Facebook groups and Twitter hashtags used 
to promote the online consultation are as follows:

The survey administered through Surve y Monkey received 52 total responses, of which 31 are complete and 
21 are incomplete. The 21 incomplete surveys are unusable in data analysis as experts either did not provide 
responses on the survey beyond the initial positive reply for participation or d id not provide any open 
responses and missed complete sections of the survey. To increase the number of completed surveys, 
experts who did not complete the survey but had agreed to be acknowledged in the final report by leaving 
their names were reminded to  complete the survey once by email or social media message. The survey was 
open from March 8, 2018 to April 8, 2018. The survey could be taken anonymously and the list of 
acknowledged expert participants for the online consultation is found in the Appendix . 
 
To capture and analyze diverse contexts, experts were asked about their organizations and countries 
represented. Based on answers to these questions, each expert was categorized according to geographical 
region and country -income -level. The profile of r espondents according to World Bank income classifications 
is: 
 High -income country experts: 12  
 Middle -upper income country experts: 9  
 Middle -lower income country experts: 2  
 Multinational, multi -income country experts (either wrote international, or listed m ore than 
one country and the countries are in different income groups): 8  
In terms of region classifications, the profile of experts is:  
 Africa experts: 3  
 Asia experts: 7  
 European Union (including Central Asia and former Soviet Union) experts: 7  
 Latin A merica experts: 4  
 Multi -region (listed countries in more than one region): 8  
 N/A (Australia, and unclassified): 2  94

Limitations and a reas for further research  
The online consultation sampling methods have several limitations in reaching experts from diverse 
developmental contexts: first, the survey was administered and promoted exclusively in English language; 
second, the use of online promotion methods do not account for experts in regions and countries, such as 
in lower -middle income or low -income countries , where there may be insufficient ICT infrastructure to 
reliably access the social media, the RIMs and the survey; third, the use of the specific social media and RIMs 
do not account for experts in regions and countries where such social media and RIMs may  be unavailable 
or not used widely; and fourth, the online consultation invitation posting to DL -related groups and hashtags, 
and to RIMs may be accessed primarily by DL researchers and practitioners in mainstream education and 
training.  
 
In general, the p roject’s sampling methods for DL frameworks, use case examples and consultation experts 
have the limitation of selecting for English -language frameworks and use cases, and English -speaking 
experts. For the proposed framework to be validated as global -level  may involve reaching out to a greater 
number of non -English -speaking experts, especially as these experts may be found in developing contexts. 
Furthermore, the sampling methods in this project required extensive use of networked technologies that 
do not a ccount for non -digital frameworks and use case examples, and for experts without reliable access 
to connectivity. We recommend scaling the discussion on the proposed framework and changing the mode 
of discussion, not least by engaging non -English speaking experts in face -to-face mode, such as in focus 
groups.

4. We will go through the competences in Table 1 and ask you to rate each competence regarding its 
importance for future development in the country and sector contexts that you are knowledgeable 
about. (0: not relevant; 1: low relevance; 2: relevant and most people have attained this competence; 
3: relevant and most people have not attained this competence.)
•0: competences 0.1, 0.2 (Canada; China --people should have attained these competences 
before entering sector)
•1: competences 2.5 (Australia ID13); 3.2 (Mexico); 3.4 (Philippines); 4.1 (Australia ID13); 4.3 
(Mexico); 4.4 (Australia ID13); 5.1 (Australia ID13); 5.2 (Mexico; Morocco); 5.2 (Australia 
ID13); 5.4 (Mexico; Morocco); Competence areas 5 and 6 (Morocco)
•2-3: most competences for most countries101

4. (Cont’d.) We will go through the competences in Table 1 and ask you to rate each competence 
regarding its importance for future development in the country and sector contexts that you are 
knowledgeable about. (0: not relevant; 1: low relevance; 2: relevant and most people have attained 
this competence; 3: relevant and most people have not attained this competence.)
Demographic reasons given for challenges in rating relevance of competences due to 
differences related to:
•Age (Brazil)
•Formal/informal economic sectors (Mexico)
•ICT Infrastructure diversity (West and Central Africa)
•Region (Brazil)
•Socio-economic status (Brazil; Czech Republic)
•Underdevelopment of public and private sector initiatives to develop DL (Tunisia)102

importance for future development in the country and sector contexts that you are knowledgeable about. (0: not 
relevant; 1: low relevance; 2: relevant and most people have attained this competence; 3: relevant and most people 
have not attained this competence.)
Cognitive and framework reasons given for challenges in rating relevance of competences due to differences 
related to:
•Broad language of competences (Brazil; Australia ID11; Australia ID13)
•People’s English language proficiency (Czech Republic)
•Tacit/implicit knowledge (Mexico; Tunisia)
•Task complexity (Brazil; Czech Republic; Tunisia; Australia ID11)
•Technological complexity (Czech Republic)
•Unconvinced by CA6 (Australia ID13)
•Unknown or emergent technologies (Brazil; Canada)
Extended competence descriptions and competence proficiency levels may address concerns about broad 
language, task complexity and technological complexity103 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
 
 
Digital Literacy Global Framework (DLGF) 
5. Are there any missing DL competences that you think should be included in the framework?
1. Framework is comprehensive (China; Philippines)
2. Competences should address cultural values and human heritage (Czech Republic)
3. Competences to address sex and cyberbullying (Mexico)
4. A safety competence of child protection and non-exploitation (West and Central Africa)
5. Ethics, empathy and community engagement (Canada)
6. Computational thinking (Canada; Tunisia; Australia ID11) 
7. Algorithmic thinking for CA0 to replace computational thinking in CA5 (Australia ID13) 
•Responses 2-5 apparently point to a need for the literacy/competence framework to include the 
attitude and value dimensions, in addition to knowledge and skills.
•On the other hand, while attitudes are important and should be a part of digital competence 
assessment, what constitutes an attitude can be confusing and attitude shouldn’t be merged with 
knowledge and skills as competence (Australia x2).104

6. Do you think a DL global framework such as the current draft should be promoted to 
support DL developments in the countries/sectors that you are familiar with? 
a. If yes, which are the key sectors/stakeholders that would be the key beneficiaries from 
having such a framework, and what strategies should be used to promote it?
Stakeholders
•Auto industry (Canada; Morocco)
•Engineering and manufacturing (Morocco)
•Teachers and educators (Australia ID13; Canada, China, Mauritius; West and 
Central Africa)
Promotion strategies
•Through influential people in key sectors/stakeholder groups (Canada; Morocco)
•Leveraging the UNESCO brand and social media (Canada)105

7. Do you have any questions about the pathway mapping methodology or the use case exemplars?
1. Micro-credentialing and digital passports: Could these pathways become micro-credentials that can be used to 
recognize individual or organizational efforts to achieve specific levels of digital literacy? (Canada) Are we talking here 
about a digital identity, digital passport so at least populations or communities or individuals that need support to 
identify those who have the skills and competences and those who don't? (Tunisia)
2. Do all the examples come from large states? (Mauritius)
3. Does the numbering of competence areas and competences in competence areas indicate a progression? (Philippines)
4. Is it your plan to establish a pathway mapping model for every potential sector in every potential job related area? 
(Canada; UK)
5. Do all the examples come from large states? (How does a small state influence the pathway? Easier to disseminate 
into everyday life and replicate in a small state) (Tunisia)
6. Implementation trajectory: Will nations lead the methodology implementation? How to translate the framework into 
national strategies, and to implement these strategies through formal and informal education? (Tunisia) 
7. Do devices include mobile phones? (Tunisia)106

7. Do you have any questions about the pathway mapping methodology or the use case exemplars?
Transcript: Is it a bottom-up process, of mapping the field according to existing notions of use? If it is, then that's fine to 
get a sense of whether the overarching framework is applicable and how it fits into different contexts. To me, the use 
case examples seem to have been selected for a socio-political purpose, which was to prove that digital technologies 
are relevant to fields where you wouldn't normally expect them to be; in fact, fields, literally. I can see the political and
marketing purpose going on: don't just think that technology is about computer programming or office work and 
education. The individual cases were not ones that I could personally identify with. I work in an office in an academic 
research. I could see their purpose, and having a broader set of unusual cases, I can see it. I'm not sure about the next 
steps of it, to me it still seemed more illustrative than analytic, if that makes sense. But maybe I'm missing something 
from it. (Australia)107

8. Do you think that this mapping methodology can in fact help stakeholders in different 
country and sector contexts identify their pathway for DL development that is most suited 
to their specific needs? If yes, how would this mapping methodology help the 
countries/sectors that you are familiar with?
Yes
•Facilitate international and inter-sector comparison and benchmarking (Brazil; Canada; 
Philippines)
•The global framework is internationally credible and contemporary (Mauritius)
•By supporting contextualization through use of video and stories (Australia ID13; Canada; 
Czech Republic)
No
•Depends on who is implementing the methodology for the local context (China)
•Useful more for illustrative purpose than for analytic process (Australia ID13)108

9. Are there specific economic areas and/or demographic groups in your country/sector 
context that would likely benefit from adopting such a pathway to plan their strategic 
digital literacy development?
•Auto sector (Canada)
•Atypical areas but not in areas where computing is clearly prevalent and useful 
(Australia ID13)
•Civic organizations (Brazil)
•Education (Brazil; Canada; China; Czech Republic; West and Central Africa)
•Elderly (Czech Republic)
•Government (Brazil; Morocco; Tunisia)
•Marginalized people e.g. homeless (Canada)
•Park, marine and environment (Canada)109

10. What difficulties do you foresee in popularizing/implementing a pathway mapping methodology? Do you have suggestions 
on how the mapping methodology can be effectively disseminated? 
Difficulties
•Comparability and assessment at global level: b/c of generic competence language (Brazil); b/c of ICT 
infrastructure digital divides (Australia x2)
•Contextualization, generalization from or lack of awareness of use cases (Australia ID13; China; Czech 
Republic; Philippines; Tunisia)
•Need for training and development organization (Philippines)
•Negative attitudes (Philippines)
•Ownership (Brazil; Canada)
•Use case focus is too complex or unclear; the work in Education is much less clear cut than the use case 
examples in Agriculture and Finance (West and Central Africa)
Suggestions
•Collaborating and consensus building through many stakeholder groups (Brazil; Czech Republic)
•Identifying sector influencers (Canada)
•Leverage UNESCO credibility (Mauritius)
•Recommendations for use (Australia ID13; Tunisia)110

on how the mapping methodology can be effectively disseminated? (Cont’d.)
Transcript: In terms of dissemination, I think it would have to be dynamic and engaging so video, 
multimedia would be the way to go. I think the challenges will be if the purpose is to generate buy-in, 
at one level the value is people somehow seeing some relation to their own lives in the case studies. 
The challenge will be that people might be saying "yes, but that's not me." "Yes, I'm a farmer but I 
do a different type of farming and this sort of weather monitoring is not..." I think the danger with 
the case study approach is that people will see it as specific, and fail to generalize from the case study 
to their own experience. If there are ways to support people to see that these are examples and this is 
the way to generalize, that would be useful. I don't know what that would look like. Practically 
speaking, some people will look at the cases and say, "That's great, but I can't afford it!" I'm not sure 
how you deal with that unless it's used as a vehicle to build ground support and industry funding for 
the actual infrastructure and equipment. In some cases people will not see it as relevant to them even 
though it would be nice if they could do it. (Australia)111

11. Do you have one current digital literacy use case example /sector contexts and one 
future use case example from an important sector in your country that we could map and 
include as a pathway in the DLGF?
Current use cases
•Education sector: Open education resources (OER) for teachers (Brazil); ICTs for instruction (West and 
Central Africa)
•Financial sector: Alipayand Wechatpay (China); SBM mobile banking and MCB juice app (Mauritius)
•Government sector: Mra.mue-tax filing and 130 government e-service (Mauritius); B3 police statement 
government e-service (Tunisia); Tax and civil document e-services (Morocco)
Future use cases
•Education sector: ICTs for system management of textbooks and human resources (West and Central Africa)
•Financial sector: female entrepreneurialism (Mauritius) 
•Government sector: an increasing number of government e-services developed by diverse departments

Summary of in -depth consultation responses to the propo sed competence areas and 
competences  
 
The addition of CA0, Devices and software operations , elicited actionable feedback from experts. Originally 
labeled, Fundamentals of hardware and software  and comprising two competences, Basic knowledge of 
hardware suc h as turning on/off and charging, locking devices , and Basic knowledge of software such as user 
account and password management, login, and how to do privacy settings, etc ., a European Union expert 
recommended making the language of the proposed CA and com petences more consistent with the 
language of the DigComp CAs and competences by removing possible reference to proficiency levels and 
specific digital technologies, and making use of Bloom’s taxonomy action verbs in writing competence 
descriptions. As a r esult, the original CA0 label was changed to Hardware and software operations , the 0.1 
label was changed to  Physical operations of digital technologies , and 0.2 was changed to Identifying data, 
information and digital content to operate digital technologie s. The descriptions for the CA0 competences 
were written using low -level Bloom’s taxonomy verbs to reflect the fundamental or basic nature of the 
CA and competences. Being more consistent with the language of DigComp would become a guiding 
principle of dev eloping additional CAs and competences to the DLGF. The revised CA0 and competence 
labels and descriptions were advanced to the online consultation stage for validation.  
 
In addition, the Canadian and Chinese experts consider CA0 to be unimportant to their  contexts’ future 
development, because people should have attained the competences before entering their economic 
sectors. Some experts find its competences to be logically better subsumed under competences within 
the existing DigComp framework. However, t he Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco and Tunisia experts referred 
to a “basic” digital literacy as necessary for their country contexts, and some experts recognize the 
importance of making these competences explicit and visible to advance DL development. The expe rt 
for countries in Western and Central, Sub -Saharan Africa said that DL would be important for her context 
were electricity and connectivity accessible, and stated that people in her context do not use ICTs because 
people cannot use ICTs.  
 
When asked if t here were any missing DL competences to be added to the framework, the most cited 
missing competence (n=3) was computational thinking. When two Australian experts were asked about 
the possible addition of computational thinking to the one expert thought co mputational thinking should 
not be visible as it could be subsumed under competence 3.4 programming. Besides, computational 
thinking could be a highly specialized competence and may not fall within everyday competences. 
Another expert thought that computat ional thinking could be a fad, and recommended computational 
thinking with algorithmic thinking as an everyday competence for CA0. As a result, computational 
thinking was added to the proposed framework as competence 5.5 in CA5, Problem solving, with the 
aims of making it distinct from programming competence 3.4 and focusing on computational thinking’s 
everyday application. Hence, the competence was advanced to the online consultation stage for 
validation.  
 
The addition of CA6, Career -related competences, d id not draw as much expert support as CA0, not least 
because some experts viewed the competence area as highly specialized, and out of place amongst more 
everyday competences. Furthermore, CA6 may not have drawn as much salient feedback because it did 
not contain language consistent with that of DigComp, and it did not originally comprise discrete 
competences, but this description under competences:  
 
Career -related competences refers to the knowledge and skills required to operate specialized 
hardware/softw are for a particular field, such as engineering design software and hardware tools, or the use 
of learning management systems to deliver fully online or blended courses.  113 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
 
To elicit more salient feedback from experts for the online consultation stage, CA6 w as developed to 
include discrete competences that maintain its higher -order thinking and specialized scope, first by 
dissecting the existing CA6 description into competence 6.1 Operating specialized digital technologies for a 
particular field , and second, adding an additional competence 6.2 Interpreting data, information and digital 
content for a particular field . The competences and their descriptions were written with language more 
consistent with existing Digcomp competences and used high -level Bloom’s t axonomy action verbs. 
These competences were to be validated at the online consultation stage.  
 
Some experts experienced difficulty in determining the importance of competences to their local 
contexts because of the generic language of competences. To add ress the issue of generic language of 
competences for the online consultation stage, we developed competence descriptions which build on 
existing descriptions and definitions from Digcomp.  114

Summary of online consultation responses to the proposed competence areas and competences  
 
The findings from the online consultation showed that 35.48% and 45.16% of experts strongly agreed 
and agreed respectively with the importance of competence  area 0 and its two competences being 
included and specified separately as in the proposed framework. All disagreement (n=1) came from a 
multinational or multi -income, multi -country expert and all strong disagreement (n=1) came from a high -
income country e xpert. All lower -middle income experts either agreed (n=1) or strongly agreed (n=1). In 
the open responses, a high -income country expert expressed a view that hardware and software are 
antiquated terms, and a high -income country expert and an upper -middle income country expert 
suggested simplifying the competence 0.2 label to speak clearly to software. Therefore, we changed the 
label of CA0 from Hardware and software operations  to Devices and software operations , and changed the 
labels of competences 0.1 an d 0.2 to be consistent in the use of the term devices and to focus on software 
in 0.2.  
 
As regards the proposed computational thinking competence, 45.16% and 25.18% of experts strongly 
agreed and agreed respectively with the importance of its inclusion in the DLGF. All lower -middle income 
country experts (n=2) strongly agreed. All disagreement (n=4) came from high -income country experts 
(n=3) and an upper -middle income country experts (n=1). In the open responses, two, high -income 
country experts were agree able to the inclusion of computational thinking as a competence upon further 
articulation of specific skills and attitudes, and use examples for the competence that differentiates it 
from a programming competence. For the open responses to all questions, o nly high -income country 
experts (n=8) and a multinational or multi -income country expert (n=1) associated computational 
thinking with programming or coding.  
 
With regard to the inclusion of the computational thinking competence in CA5, 51.61% and 32.26% of  
experts strongly agreed and agreed respectively with the importance of the inclusion of CA5 and its five 
competences in the DLGF. All strong disagreement (n=1) came from a high -income country expert, and 
disagreement (n=1) from a multinational or multi -income country expert. In the open responses, two, 
high -income country experts expressed concern with the inclusion of computational thinking in CA5, as 
a matter of their associating computational thinking with programming.  
 
The findings from the online con sultation showed that 25.81% and 41.94% of experts strongly agreed 
and agreed respectively with the importance of including CA6 and its two competences in the DLGF. Out 
of the seven, proposed CAs, CA6 showed the least number of experts (n=21) who either ag reed or 
strongly agreed with the importance of the inclusion of the CA and its competences in the DLGF. All 
lower -middle income country experts (n=2) agreed. Three high -income country experts and one high -
income country expert disagreed and strongly disagr eed respectively; and one multinational, multi -
income expert and one upper -middle income expert disagreed and strongly disagreed respectively. In 
the open responses, it seems some experts view the scope of the CA as too narrow, redundant or 
disconnected fo r a global framework. Some experts suggest the CA could benefit from greater 
specification of examples of career -related skills and roles.  
 
To further clarify the framework after the online consultation, summaries of each competence area were 
developed fo r CA0 and CA6 which build on the existing competence area descriptions from Digcomp. A 
CA description is a summary of competence labels.  
 
As regards the proposed pathway mapping methodology, 16.13% and 61.29% of experts strongly agreed 
and agreed respectiv ely to the statement that the pathway mapping methodology provides a useful 
method to make use of the DLGF in a local/national context. However, 9.68% and 41.94% of experts 131 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
strongly agreed and agreed respectively to finding it easy to follow the steps desc ribed in the pathway 
mapping methodology. In open responses, experts see the limitation of the specific use context 
examples presented in the proposed pathway mapping methodology as a limitation in their 
understanding the pathway mapping methodology.

Appendix 16. Draft executive summary of Digital Literacy Global Framework (DLGF) for in -
depth consultation  
Hong Kong University Centre for Information Technology in Education for the Global Alliance to Monitor 
Learning / UNESCO Institute for Statistics  
Backgr ound  
Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) represents the international education agenda for the period 2015 -
2030. Target 4.4, which is one of its ten targets, focuses on “ relevant skills, including technical and vocational 
skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship ” among youth and adults. In the absence of many 
indicators that can compare similar and relevant job -related skills across countries at different levels of 
development, the monitoring framework for target 4.4 focuses on ICT and di gital literacy skills. Thematic 
indicator 4.4.2 is the “ percentage of youth/adults who have achieved at least a minimum level of proficiency in 
digital literacy skills. ” 
Just as with many other learning outcome indicators in the SDG 4 monitoring agenda, th ere is no consensus 
on what digital literacy skills are and how they could be monitored. To address this gap, the UNESCO Institute 
for Statistics (UIS), which is the custodian agency for collecting data on SDG 4 has set up the Global Alliance 
to Monitor Le arning (GAML), under which the task force for indicator 4.4.2 has set as its first task the 
development of a global framework for digital literacy skills. UIS has contracted for this purpose the Hong 
Kong University Centre for Information Technology in Edu cation to propose a framework and consult with 
stakeholders around the world. This is the executive summary of the draft digital literacy global framework, 
which is the document to be consulted in the first half of 2018.  
Definition  
In reviewing DL -related  frameworks collected from government and non -government agencies, we find that 
these frameworks’ digital literacy definitions always include the specification of competence areas and tools. 
For the purposes of this project, we adopt the following definiti on of digital literacy:  
Digital literacy is the ability to define, access, manage, integrate, communicate, evaluate and create information 
safely and appropriately through digital technologies and networked devices for participation in economic and 
social life. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, information 
literacy, data literacy and media literacy.  
Approach  
We have taken as our starting point the European Commission’s Digital Competence Framework for  Citizens 
(DigComp 2.0), as it has been developed on the basis of extensive research and consultation in the EU 
countries. The proposed framework is underpinned by two sets of mapping to the DigComp 2.0 framework: 
(1) DL curriculum and assessment framework s at cross -national, national and sub -national levels, and (2) 
use examples of digital literacy in major areas of social economic activity. The frameworks and use examples 
have been collected from countries in the following regions: Asia; Sub -Saharan Afric a; Middle East and North 
Africa; Latin America; European Union; High -income countries outside European Union.  
Mapping of Digital Literacy Frameworks  
We have conducted English -language searches for DL frameworks in the targeted regions using country 
names i n combination with search terms, including digital, literacy, com petences, skills, ICT, computer  and 
information. We have found information about specific DL frameworks being adopted i n 43 countries from 133 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
high - to low -income levels according to World Bank r ating s. We have selected seven national frameworks 
that are most clearly written with regard to the competency areas as well as three popular enterprise 
frameworks found in numerous countries to map to the DigComp 2.0 framework. We have developed a low -
inference coding scheme to map competences from the identified DL frameworks to DigComp 2.0. The 
mapping results show that there are two competences referred to in these frameworks that are qualitatively 
different from any competences defined in DigComp 2.0, which warrant the creation of new competence 
areas in the global framework. The first proposed area relates to the basic operations of digital devices and 
is labelled Fundamentals of hardware and software . The second relates to specific careers or career 
opportunities and is labelled Career -related competences . Table 1 shows the DigComp 2.0 competences and 
areas with the proposed competences and competence areas. We found only one national framework that 
has a full coverage of all competences presented in D igComp 2.0. While we note the differences in the origin 
and intended usage of the analyzed frameworks, we do not observe any specific pattern of competence 
coverage that are specifically related to the state of economic development of the originating count ries. We 
also did not find any DL framework that provided such systematic descriptions of different proficiency levels 
as DigComp 2.1.

specialized hardware/software for a particular field, such as engineering design 
software and hardware tools, or the use of learning management systems to deliver 
fully online or blended courses . 
Note : Underscored competence areas and competences are proposed additions to the existing DigComp 
2.0 competence areas and competences.  134 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
Mapping Examples of Digital Literacy Use in Everyday Contexts  
DigComp 2.1 includes use examples to provide vivid illu strations of the different levels of proficiency 
required to adequately address the DL competence needed under different authentic situations. The 
usefulness of these European examples motivated us to gather everyday digital literacy use examples under 
different cultural, economic and technological settings as an additional empirical input to our development 
of the DLGF. We have focused our search for use examples in low - and middle - income countries, and in 
major economic or employment areas: agriculture, energy, finance, and transportation. We used English -
language searches in a snowball process on Google and YouTube to find news articles, videos, non -
governmental organizational reports, software applications and company websites with rich information on 
everyday digital technology use in the four selected economic areas. Of the 42 initial use examples, we 
selected 17 highly detailed examples to map to DigComp 2.1. We identified 13 general functions of 
smartphone and basic mobile phone use grounded in these  use examples, and mapped the DL competences 
required to operationalize these functions to the proposed framework presented in Table 1.  
An important finding of the mapping exercise is that even though the 17 use examples covered all four 
economic sectors i nvolving the use of both mobile and smart phones, the DL competences mapped covered 
only half (11) of the 22 competences in the framework. The absence of 11 of the competences in this 
mapping exercise suggests that they are not immediately necessary or use ful to everyday operations in a 
wide range of developmental contexts. Basic technical and interactive competences seem more immediately 
necessary. Another important finding is that the competences associated with the examples of use are 
strongly differenti ated based on the nature of the device used.  
Pathways for Digital Literacy Development and Assessment  
For the purpose of designing curricula and assessment, we recommend that DL frameworks should include 
descriptions of proficiency and examples of use. We  further recommend that in determining the 
competences to emphasize and proficiency levels to target in a country’s DL strategic development plan, a 
country should adopt a pathway mapping methodology as developed and included in this proposed DLGF. 
By conn ecting the DLGF with meaningful illustrative examples of use suited to the social, economic and 
cultural development needs of specific countries through the mapping methodology, stakeholders in 
different countries can have a systematic contextualized appro ach to identify appropriate DL development 
goals and strategies.  
Based on examples of use that are meaningful for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship in specific 
sectors, and sensitive to the relevant ICT context, one can design meaningful pathway s of digital literacy 
development. In other words, the developmental context determines the pathway to digital literacy and by 
comparing developmental contexts, a country can make decisions to change its context and to show 
progress on pathways to digital literacy. Each pathway comprises competences and task contexts grounded 
in examples of use. A pathway may involve more than one device type, and more than one sector, 
representing how in some developmental contexts, digital literacy competence for employme nt, decent jobs 
and entrepreneurship is closely linked with a set of interrelated sectors and technologies. A pathway can be 
further elaborated for different roles in an economic sector.   135

Next steps  
This draft document is the first step in the process:  
 It adds two new competences to the DigComp 2.0 framework that are likely to be relevant in low - 
and middle -income countries: basic operations of digital devices and career -related competences; 
and 
 It proposes a methodology for further extending the breadth and  depth of the framework in these 
two competences.  
The second step is to consult in depth with a select and representative group of experts from different parts 
of the world with the objective to:  
 validate the methodological approach for extending DigComp 2 .0 from a high -income country -
centric to a proposed global framework; and  
 enrich the proposed global framework, especially with respect to more use examples  
The third step is to then consult widely with a large number of experts from different countries to  finalize 
the proposed framework. Following that, existing assessments will be mapped on to the framework and 
gaps will be identified in assessments that would need to be addressed in the next phase of the project.

Pathway Mapping Methodology Questions  
In order that the DLGF can be a useful resource to guide digital literacy development and  assessment for 
diverse country and sector developmental contexts, the project team has developed a pathway mapping 
methodology to guide countries, sectors, groups and individuals to develop strategies and plans for 
advancing their own digital literacy dev elopment goals and pathways. A pathway for digital literacy 
development can be developed through comparing use case exemplars for specific targeted contexts to 
identify the difference in digital literacy competence required for adequate performance between  the 
popular current use exemplar and the use exemplar to aspire to.  
In the project website, we have illustrated the methodology through showing how three use scenarios of DL, 
each involving a farmer at different levels of DL use sophistication, can be map ped to the competences in 
the DLGF. The difference in DL between the existing popular use and the targeted, more advanced use 
scenario would be the priority focus for DL development for the specific context.  
  139 
 A Global Framework of Reference on Digital Literacy Skills for Indicator 4.4.2  
Referring to the use case exemplars and the pa thway mapping methodology page on the website, we would 
like to get your feedback on the following:  
 
1. Do you have any questions about the pathway mapping methodology or the use case exemplars?  
2. Do you think that this mapping methodology can in fact help sta keholders in different country 
and sector contexts identify their pathway for DL development most suited to their specific 
needs? How would this mapping methodology help the countries/sectors that you are familiar 
with?  
3. Are there specific economic areas an d/or demographic groups in your country/sector context 
that would likely benefit from adopting such a pathway to plan their strategic digital literacy 
development?  
4. What difficulties do you foresee in popularizing/implementing a pathway mapping methodology?  
Do you have suggestions on how the mapping methodology can be effectively disseminated?  
5.  "Do you have one current digital literacy use case example /sector contexts and one future use 
case example from an important sector in your country that we could ma p and include as a 
pathway in the DLGF?"  
d. If yes, would you mind sharing the URL or relevant resource with us? Thank you!

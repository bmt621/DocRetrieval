Module 1: Getting Started with Technology

1.1.1 The Operating System 

An operating system is a set of software that manages computer hardware and provides common services for computer programs.

Operating systems are not one-size-fits-all. They need to be adapted to the needs of the user, which means that even though there are many different types of OS, there is not a perfect OS for everyone. 



1.1.1 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.1.2 Evolution in Some of the Operating Systems 

There are many different types of operating systems that are used in computers and mobile phones. We have the "DOS" which stands for "Disk Operating System." It was developed in the early days of computing as a way to store and retrieve data from floppy disks. We also have what is called a "Windows" which was also developed in the early days of computing as an alternative to DOS. Windows has been around since 1985 and is still popular today. Another type of operating system is called a Unix, which has been around since 1969.

There is also another called Linux, which was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. This operating system can be found on many servers and embedded systems that power smartphones, tablets, video game consoles, TVs and other electronics devices. Linux has been around for over 25 years now and it continues to grow more popular every year as more people start using it on their computers as well as their mobile devices.

1.1.3 Desktop Operating Systems

Desktop operating systems are the most common type of operating system. They are mainly used for desktop computers and Notebooks.

The first desktop computer was created in the 1970s by IBM and it was called "IBM Personal Computer". The first commercially successful desktop computer was Apple's Macintosh, which was introduced in 1984. It had a graphical user interface, which made it easier to use than other desktop computers at the time.

In the 1990s, Microsoft released Windows 95 and 98, which were also successful because they ran on a new architecture called "Windows NT". These were followed by Windows XP and Vista, then Windows 7 and 8. Windows 10 was released after Windows 8. 



In 2008, Apple released Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (version 10.6), followed by Mac OS X 10.7 Lion (version 10.7) in 2011, Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion (version 10.8) in 2012, Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks (version 10.9) etc.

1.1.4 Mobile Operating Systems

Mobile OSs are designed for phones, tablets, or any other mobile device. They control how programs and features work on your device. And they are what make it possible for you to use those features in the first place.

There are many different types of OSs available today. The most popular ones are iOS (for iPhones and iPads), Android (for smartphones and tablets), Windows (for laptops and desktops), macOS (for Mac computers) and Chrome OS (a lightweight operating system).



1.1.4 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.2.1 Knowing Your Web Browser

Web browsers are a software application that renders web pages. They are designed to interpret and display the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from the web page.

The first web browser is called "WorldWideWeb" which was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. The first graphical web browser was called "Nexus", which was developed by University of Illinois in 1993. 

The first browser was very basic and had no graphical interface but it allowed people to view hyperlinked documents on the web.

The most popular browsers are Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. These browsers have different features like cookies management or private browsing mode. They also have different security settings that might be more or less secure depending on what you need them for.

Google Chrome was created in 2008 by Google and it has been growing in popularity ever since. In 2012, Chrome became the most popular web browser in use on desktops worldwide. It is now used more than 60% of desktop users around the world and this number continues to grow as time goes on.

Mozilla Firefox was created by Netscape Communications Corporation back in 2002 as an alternative to Internet Explorer which dominated at that time. It has also been growing steadily over time.

1.2.2 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.3.1 Getting Started with Your Credentials  

Before you can use or access information of any computing device, you need to set up a User Account first, i.e. using your basic information such as Name, Phone No, Email, Address etc. Some features can only be accessible, if the User has the right and privilege to access or view them. 

Windows 10 has two built-in user account types: administrator and standard. Administrator accounts have complete control over the computer, while standard accounts have limited or defined control. A User, as an administrator account can set up other standard account(s), especially if they share the computer with other people. 

You can also create guest accounts, which are limited accounts that expire after a certain period of time. Guest accounts are useful if you want to give someone temporary access to your computer.

1.3.2 Create, Manage, and delete user accounts

1.3.2.1 Creating a user account with an administrator account

If you have an administrator account on your computer, you can use it to create a user account. This will give you access to all the same features as the administrator account, but with more security. To create a user account, follow these steps:

Open the Control Panel.

Click on the User Accounts icon.

Click on the Create a new account link.

Enter a name for the account.

Select the type of account you want to create.

Click on the Create Account button.

Once you have created the account, you can start using it immediately.



1.3.2.1 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________





1.3.2.2 Managing user accounts - students and adults

Assuming you want to set up user accounts for a school:

There are a few ways to go about managing user accounts for students and adults. The best method will likely vary depending on the size of the school and the number of users.

One option is to have a separate account for each student and adult. This way, you can easily keep track of who is logging in and when. You can also set up different permissions for each account, so that students have limited access to certain areas of the school website or network.

Another option is to have a single account for all users. This can be more convenient for users, but it can be more difficult to manage. You will need to be careful about setting permissions and making sure that only the appropriate people have access to certain areas.



1.3.2.2 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.3.2.3 Deleting user accounts

Deleting user accounts is a simple process that can be completed in a few steps. First, log in to your account management system. Then, locate the user you wish to delete and click on their name. Next, click the "Delete" button. You will be asked to confirm the deletion - click "OK" to complete the process.

Keep in mind that deleting a user account is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Make sure you really want to delete the account before taking this final step.



1.3.2.3 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.3.3 Using Your Credentials Online  

Your Personal Credentials which comes with your User Account is your clearance pass, while you access tools and features online. Therefore, the accounts or the information you have provided online is a key requirement for user online access and user online experience i.e access to online services, preference, security etc.

1.4.1 The Windows Graphical User Interface

1.4.2 The Start Menu

The Start Menu has been a major part of the Windows operating system ever since version 95. Some people loved it and others hated it, but it was a part of the Windows OS that could not be removed. Now, with Windows 10, the Start Menu has returned in full form. It’s been completely redesigned and has many new features and abilities. For instance, it now includes an integrated search box that can search your computer as well as the Internet. The Start Menu menu is also much easier to customize than it was in previous versions of Windows. You can add and remove menu items, as well as change the menu’s appearance with different color schemes and backgrounds.



1.4.2 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.4.3 The Taskbar

The Taskbar is a small bar located at the bottom of the Windows desktop. It’s the same place where you would normally find icons representing applications such as your web browser or word processor. In Windows 10, the Taskbar has undergone a few changes that make it easier to use. The most noticeable change is the disappearance of the “Start Menu” button that has been featured on the Taskbar since Windows 95. Instead, the Taskbar now contains buttons for the Start Menu and other common OS functions. You can also pin application icons to the Taskbar so that they are easily accessible at all times. Most significantly, the Taskbar can now automatically hide itself when it is not in use. This saves valuable desktop space and increases the amount of information that can be displayed on the desktop.



1.4.3 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.4.4 Windows and Tabs

Windows are the individual “pages” that are being displayed on your computer monitor. All of the open web pages, documents, and applications are displayed inside of these windows. There are several different ways to open new windows on your computer. One of the easiest ways is to grab the title bar at the top of the active window and drag it down towards the bottom of the screen. Windows 10 allows you to open and display multiple windows simultaneously. The most common way to do this is to open a new window by clicking the “New Tab” icon in your web browser. This creates a new tab that is displayed beside the currently active tab. You can then switch between tabs as needed to quickly access different windows.



1.4.4 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



1.4.5 Understanding the Windows 10 Desktop Bar

The Desktop Bar is a new feature introduced in Windows 10. It’s a toolbar that can be displayed at the top of the screen and contains buttons that can be used to control many of the Windows functions. One of the most common reasons to display the Desktop Bar is to access the system menu. This menu can be used to shut down or restart your computer. You can also use the Desktop Bar to search for files and folders, create new folders, and view Windows notifications.

Keep it simple - don't try to cram too much information into one slide. Remember that your audience will only be able to process a limited amount of information at a time.



Use high-quality images - low-quality images will make your presentation look unprofessional. Use high-resolution images that are clear and easy to see.

Use charts and diagrams - they can help your audience visualize complex data.

Be consistent - use the same font and color scheme throughout your presentation. This will create a sense of cohesion and make your presentation look more polished.

Proofread - before you hit the "save" button, make sure you proofread your presentation for any typos or errors.

Module 9: Becoming a Digital Native 

9.1.1 Defining Identities

Social media and online communities are shifting our identities in a way that requires every technology user to develop an understanding of the personal, professional, and civic aspects of their online presence.

The personal and professional online identities are about who you are, what you believe in, and how you present yourself to the world. While there is no standard for each identity, one’s reputation can be shaped by the way they communicate on social media. The professional online identity is characterized by integrity, honesty, being open and authentic.

The personal brand is the public self that you present online to the world, while your professional brand is the set of skills and attributes associated with your job. In a digital age, your personal and professional identities are inseparable.

A personal and professional online identity are two distinct yet complementary aspects of your online presence. Your personal identity is who you're trying to be and what you hope to achieve in life. You may have established a physical identity, like your name or profession, but how do you represent that on the Internet? This can be done through your public persona or even through your business brand.



9.1.1 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



9.1.2 Your Online Accounts

Personal and professional online identities can be confusing. You may have more than one online identity, or not even know you have one. The solution is to create separate, exclusive profiles for each. By using unique usernames that describe your work and personal life, you help preserve your true self in cyberspace and keep it from being stolen by thieves and scammers.



9.1.2 Illustrations_____________________________________________________________________________



9.1.3 Switching between Accounts

What you are called at work may be different with what family and friends call you. You also correspond with colleagues and associates with an official office mail. While, out of office, you communicate with your personal email (public). You may want to stay in touch with friends and family while at work, and you there are simpler ways to do that.

You can check your personal email account, and still stay connected to work accounts on the same computer. No logging out of your company email inbox or navigating away from the current pages in your browser. You can find a way that works with nearly any app: sync files and notes from multiple accounts, juggle a handful of Twitter or Instagram accounts in the same browser, or swap between work and personal emails with just two clicks. Find out some points below:

"Add Account" option for Instagram and some Other Social Media Platforms.  Now there's no more logging out to switch accounts. Just tap on your username, then tap again on the username for the account you wish to post to. 

Google: you can switch between multiple accounts whether you're perusing your email on the web or in the Gmail mobile app.  To do so, you'll need to add a second account, but once that's done, switching between the two—whether on Android, iOS or the web—is just a few taps away. 

You can then switch accounts in almost any other Google app, to edit personal and work Google Docs or upload videos to any of your YouTube profiles

When setting up multiple accounts, use different avatars in order to quickly see the account you're logged in to. 

Gmail allows you to receive email from more than one email accounts—including Outlook and accounts from other email services—inside one Gmail account by forwarding messages and using aliases to send messages.

Microsoft: If your email runs through Office 365 or Outlook, however, there's no way to natively switch between two accounts. You'll either need to rely on signing in and out, using a third-party app or switching between browsers or devices.

11.1.3 Applying and Customizing Styles

Imagine you're working with a really long document in Microsoft Word, like an academic paper or a big report. 

Depending on the project, it might be dozens or even hundreds of pages long! When a document is this large, it can be difficult to remember which page has what information. Fortunately, Word allows you to insert a table of contents, making it easy to organize and navigate your document. A table of contents is just like the list of chapters at the beginning of a book. 

It lists each section in the document and the page number where that section begins. A really basic table of contents might look like this: You could create a table of contents manually—typing the section names and page numbers—but it would take a lot of work. And if you ever decide to rearrange your sections or add more information, you'll have to update everything all over again. 

However, with the right formatting, Word can create and update a table of contents automatically. 

Step 1: Apply heading styles. Styles also serve another important purpose: adding a hidden layer of organization and structure to your document. If you apply a heading style, you are telling Word that you have started a new part of your document. When you insert the table of contents, it will create a section for each heading. 

In the table of contents above, each chapter uses a heading style, so there are four sections. To apply a heading style, select the text you want to format, then choose the desired heading in the Styles group on the Home tab. 

Step 2: Insert the table of contents now for the easy part! Once you've applied heading styles, you can insert your table of contents in just a few clicks. Navigate to the References tab on the Ribbon, then click the Table of Contents command. Select a built-in table from the menu that appears, and the table of contents will appear in your document. As you can see in the image below, the table of contents uses the heading styles in your document to determine where each section begins. 

Sections that begin with a Heading 2 or Heading 3 style will be nested within a Heading 1 style, much like a multilevel list. A table of contents also creates links for each section, allowing you to navigate to different parts of your document.

Just hold the Ctrl key on your keyboard and click to go to any section. 

Step 3: Update as needed if you edit or add to your document, it's easy to update the table of contents. Just select the table of contents, click Update Table, and choose Update Entire Table in the dialog box that appears. The table of contents will then update to reflect any changes. No matter how large your document may be, you can see there's nothing complicated about creating a table of contents.

11.2 Customizing Presentations

11.2.1 Animating Text and Objects

You can animate text and objects such as clip art, shapes, and pictures. Animation—or movement—on the slide can be used to draw the audience's attention to specific content or to make the slide easier to read.

There are several animation effects you can choose from, some are as follows:

Effect options: Some effects will have options you can change. For example, with the Fly In effect you can control which direction the object comes from. These options can be accessed from the Effect Options command in the Animation group. 

To remove an animation: Animations are best used in moderation. Adding too many animations can make your presentation look a little silly and can even be distracting to your audience. Consider using mostly subtle animations, or not using animations at all. 

Working with animations: To add multiple animations to an object: If you select a new animation from the menu in the Animation group, it will replace the object's current animation.

However, you would sometimes want to place more than one animation on an object, like an Entrance and an Exit effect. To do this, you'll need to use the Add Animation command, which will allow you to keep your current animations while adding new ones. 

To reorder the animations: To copy animations with the Animation Painter: In some cases, you may want to apply the same effects to more than one object. You can do this by copying the effects from one object to another using the Animation Painter. 

To preview animations: Any of the animation effects you have applied will show up when you play the slide show. However, you can also quickly preview the animations for the current slide without viewing the slide show. 

The Animation Panel: The Animation Pane allows you to view and manage all of the effects that are on the current slide. You can modify and reorder effects directly from the Animation Panel, which is especially useful when you have several effects. 

Opening Animation Panel: If you have several animated objects, it may help to rename the objects before reordering them in the Animation Panel. You can rename them in the Selection Panel. 

To open the Selection Panel, click an object, then from the Format tab click Selection Panel. Double-click the name of an object to rename it. 

To reorder effects from the Animation Panel: 

To preview effects from the Animation Panel: If the timeline is not visible, click the drop-down arrow for an effect, then select Show Advanced Timeline. 

To change an effect's start option: By default, an effect starts playing when you click the mouse during a slide show. If you have multiple effects, you will need to click multiple times to start each effect individually. However, by changing the start option for each effect, you can have effects that automatically play at the same time or one after the other. 

When you preview the animations, all of the effects will play through automatically. To test effects that are set to start on Click, you will need to play the slide show.
